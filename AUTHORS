SWIG support
============

Chris Wilson did the groundwork on a previous version of the SWIG
support for Perl.  Chris can be contacted at <emdros@qwirx.com>.

Kirk E. Lowery contributed SWIG support for Ruby.

Kirk also has been a huge encouragement throughout the existence of
Emdros.  He also kindly provided access to some seriously powerful 64
bit hardware, back when that was rare, so that Emdros could support
64-bit operating systems. Kirk also provided help with performance
testing, and wrote a scholarly paper about Emdros in a journal.



Other Contributions
===================

Martin Korshoej Petersen wrote most of the ImportToolWizard machinery.

Hendrik Jan Bosman wrote at least two early versions of the Emdros
Query Tool.  Many of his algorithms can still be traced in the current
Emdros Query Tool, although none of his code is in there.  Many thanks
to Hendrik Jan Bosman for his constant support since the beginnings of
Emdros.
