--- NOTE for Win32 users  ---
-----------------------------

These instructions are not for Win32 users, but for Unix/Linux users.
For instructions on how to install on Win32 platforms, please see the
file INSTALL.Win32.txt.

-----------------------------

Requirements
============

Platforms supported
-------------------

The following *nix platforms are supported by Emdros, and thus are
known to work:

- Linux x86, x86_64 and ARM
- Solaris 10 on SPARC hardware
- Mac OS X 10.9 and later (see INSTALL.Mac.txt)
- iOS (any version; see README-Emdros-on-iOS.txt)
- Android (see README-Emdros-on-Android.txt)

In addition, Emdros releases are regularly compiled and tested on
Windows.  It should work on:

- Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, and 10 (see INSTALL.Win32.txt)

There have been reports of Emdros compiling and running on *BSD,
including NetBSD and FreeBSD.  These platforms are not regularly
tested, however.




In general
----------

The emdros package needs the following software:

- If you wish to use PostgreSQL as a backend:
  - PostgreSQL plus development headers and libraries.
- If you wish to use MySQL as a backend:
  - MySQL plus development headers and libraries
- For SWIG'ified interfaces:
  - SWIG version 2.0.12 or later.

PostgreSQL versions prior to 8.2.0 will not work with Emdros.  For
best results, use the latest stable version of PostgreSQL.  On Win32,
PostgreSQL 8.3 or later is required.

It is unknown how far back the versions of MySQL will work.  For best
results, use the latest stable MySQL.

The specific PostgreSQL library needed by Emdros is:

- libpq.a

The specific MySQL library needed by Emdros is:

- libmysqlclient.a

CentOS
------

On CentOS 7.0 (and presumably RHEL 7.0), installing the following
packages will pull in the minimal set required for building Emdros as
an RPM with support for MariaDB (MySQL), PostgreSQL, and Python.

yum install gcc-c++ make binutils groff gcc glibc-devel glibc-headers kernel-headers groff libgomp libstdc++-devel python-devel mariadb mariadb-server mariadb-devel postgresql postgresql-server postgresql-devel rpm-build


Fedora
------

On Fedora 26-29, the following packages are required to build the full
gamut of Emdros programs and libraries, even after a "make distclean"
or a "make clean":

gcc-c++ make binutils groff gcc glibc-devel glibc-headers kernel-headers groff libgomp libstdc++-devel re2c transfig lyx latex2html swig autoconf automake libtool wxGTK3 wxGTK3-devel ImageMagick texlive-a4wide texlive-times texlive-courier texlive-ulem texlive-epstopdf-bin texlive-latex pkg-config

The following packages are optional on Fedora:

java-1.8.0-openjdk java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel python-devel python3-devel php-devel mono-core mysql mysql-server mysql mysql-devel postgresql postgresql-server postgresql-devel 

Ubuntu
------

There are two cases:

i) You want to build a .deb for Emdros from a tarball.

ii) You want to be able to do a "make distclean" and build from there.

Building a .deb from an Emdros tarball
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

For case number (i) and (ii), the minimum you need is pulled in with:

sudo apt-get install g++ make binutils zlib1g zlib1g-dev build-essential fakeroot debhelper pkg-config

The following are all optional for cases (i) and (ii).

GUI support:
sudo apt install libwxgtk-webview3.0-dev libwxgtk3.0-dev libwxgtk-media3.0-dev xdg-utils 

MySQL support:
sudo apt install libmysqlclient-dev mysql-client mysql-server

MariaDB support (drop-in replacement for, and mutually exclusive with, MySQL):
sudo apt install libmariadbclient-dev libmariadbclient-dev-compat mariadb-client mariadb-server

PostgreSQL support:
sudo apt install postgresql libpq-dev postgresql-client

SWIG bindings support:
Java:    sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk
Python2: sudo apt install python-dev
Python3: sudo apt install python3-dev
Mono/C#: sudo apt install mono-devel mono-mcs mono-tools-devel
PHP7:    sudo apt install php-dev

To bring all language bindings in:
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk python-dev python3-dev mono-devel mono-mcs mono-tools-devel php-dev 

To build a .deb:

$ tar xfzv emdros-x.y.z.tar.gz
$ cd emdros-x.y.z
$ dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -d -us -uc

To install the .deb:

$ cd ..
$ sudo dpkg -i emdros_x.y.x*.deb



For case number (ii), you need to read on.


Building after make distclean
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

On Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial), you will need a PPA for LyX:

https://launchpad.net/~lyx-devel/+archive/ubuntu/release

In short:

1. sudo apt-get remove lyx
2. sudo apt-get autoremove
3. sudo add-apt-repository ppa:lyx-devel/release
4. sudo apt-get update
5. sudo apt-get install lyx
6. lyx
[i.e, run LyX]

After this, the following command will bring in everything needed to
build after make distclean:

sudo apt-get install transfig lyx latex2html swig3.0 autoconf automake libtool groff imagemagick autotools-dev re2c

If SWIG support for PHP 5.6 is required, you need to install the
following PPA, with the following commands:

sudo LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php
sudo apt-get update

Do this _before_ installing the php5.6-dev package.


The following packages are optional, but add more functionality if
installed before building:

openjdk-8-jdk python-dev python3-dev mono-devel mono-mcs mono-tools-devel php-dev libmysqlclient-dev mysql-client mysql-server postgresql libpq-dev postgresql-client 

SWIG version 3.0.11 or higher is required if you wish to do a "make
distclean" and still have support for PHP7.



Older versions of Ubuntu
::::::::::::::::::::::::

On Ubuntu 14.10 (Utopic Unicorn), the following command will bring in
everything needed to build a .deb:

sudo apt-get install g++ make binutils re2c transfig lyx latex2html swig3.0 autoconf automake libtool libwxgtk3.0-dev libwxgtk-media3.0-dev openjdk-7-jdk python-dev mono-devel mono-gmcs mono-tools-devel libmysqlclient-dev mysql-client mysql-server postgresql libpq-dev postgresql-client groff imagemagick xdg-utils zlib1g-dev build-essential fakeroot debhelper autotools-dev libwxgtk-webview3.0-dev

On Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr), the following command will bring in
everything needed to build a .deb:

sudo apt-get install g++ make binutils re2c transfig lyx latex2html swig autoconf automake libtool libwxgtk3.0-dev libwxgtk-media3.0-dev openjdk-7-jdk python-dev mono-devel mono-gmcs mono-tools-devel libmysqlclient-dev mysql-client mysql-server postgresql libpq-dev postgresql-client groff imagemagick xdg-utils zlib1g-dev build-essential fakeroot debhelper autotools-dev 

On Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS, and possibly others, the minimum packages
needed to build a .deb of Emdros from an Emdros release tarball will
be pulled in with the following.

sudo apt-get install make g++ libwxgtk3.0-0 libwxgtk3.0-dev libwxgtk-media3.0-dev zlib1g-dev build-essential fakeroot debhelper autotools-dev 

Note that this does not pull in PostgreSQL or MySQL, so unless their
development packages are installed, support for these will not be
compiled in.



Building RPMs
=============

If you wish to build RPMs of emdros, try this:

$ rpmbuild -ta emdros-X.Y.Z.tar.gz

On Fedora, you can do this:

$ rpmbuild -ta --target i686-redhat-linux emdros-X.Y.Z.tar.gz

in order to build it for the i686.

The RPMs build will be in ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/$(arch)/, e.g.:
~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/


CentOS: Installing the built RPMs
---------------------------------

On CentOS 7 (and presumably RHEL 7), you can do:

sudo yum localinstall ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/emdros-*X.Y.Z*.rpm

... where "X.Y.Z" is the version you have just compiled (e.g.,
"3.5.15").


Fedora: Installing the built RPMs
---------------------------------

On Fedora 21 and up, you can do:

sudo dnf install ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/emdros-*X.Y.Z*.rpm

... where "X.Y.Z" is the version you have just compiled (e.g.,
"3.5.15").


Building the BPT engine inside of an RPM
----------------------------------------

1) Get the source code for Emdros and unpack it.

2) Go to the root of the Emdros sources, and unzip the ZIP file
containing the BPT source code, overwriting all files.

3) ./configure

4) make dist

   This  produces  a  new  tarball  (given that  you  have  everything
   installed  as directed  in  the INSTALL  file).   This tarball  now
   includes the BPT sources.

5) rpmbuild -ta <path/to/new/emdros/tarball.tar.gz>






Building .debs
==============

1) First, you should install packages so as to be able to build
Emdros.  See above under "Requirements -> Ubuntu".

2) Second, you should install any packages needed for building the
.debs, mentioned above.

3) Build the .debs.

3a) Place the tarball in a directory, such as $HOME/build.  We'll
assume you have placed them there for the remainder of this tutorial.

3b) cd ~/build

3c) tar xfvz emdros-x.y.z.tar.gz (where x.y.z is the version number of
your Emdros tarball).

3d) cd emdros-x.y.z (where, again, x.y.z is the version number of your
Emdros).

3e) If you have any special configure switches you need to supply to
configure, edit the file "debian/rules".  DO NOT run configure
manually.  It is run from debian/rules as part of dpkg-buildpackage
-rfakeroot command (the next step).

3f) dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -d -us -uc

This should build the .debs in $HOME/build/.  If this fails with an
error, or it builds a .deb with a wrong version, _please_ get in touch
with the Emdros author, Ulrik Sandborg-Petersen, by email:
ulrikp<at>emdros|dot|org.  Thanks in advance for your help!

4) Install the .debs

cd ~/build

dpkg -i emdros_x.y.z*.deb



Building the BPT engine inside of a .deb
----------------------------------------

1) Get the source code for Emdros and unpack it.

$ tar xfzv /path/to/emdros/sources/emdros-a.b.c.tar.gz


2) Go to the root of the Emdros sources, and unzip the ZIP file
containing the BPT source code, overwriting all files.

$ unzip /path/to/bpt/sources/bpt-x.y.z.zip


3) Run ./configure

$./configure

At this point, any options you give to configure will be carried over
into the debian/rules file, meaning they will also be effective after
you run make dist.  For example, you could do the following instead of
merely configure:

./configure  --with-swig-language-nodejs=no --with-swig-language-java=no  --with-swig-language-python2=yes  --with-swig-language-python3=yes --with-swig-language-php7=no --with-swig-language-php=no --with-wx=maybe  --with-sqlite3=yes  --with-mysql=no  --with-bpt=maybe  --with-bpt2=maybe --enable-shared=yes  --disable-debug  

Then these options will be carried over into debian/rules, via
debian/rules.in.

4) make dist

   This  produces  a  new  tarball  (given that  you  have  everything
   installed  as directed  in  the INSTALL  file).   This tarball  now
   includes the BPT sources.

5) Follow the instructions above, using the Emdros tarball made in
step (4).






Installing from sources
=======================

The basic procedure is as follows (but *please* read what follows
these steps):

1. ./configure
2. make
3. make install

You may need to use GNU make.  But try your native make first.  It
should work.

Options
-------

Unless you explicitly tell the configure-script using command-line
switches, it will try to detect what's available on your system, and
then allow you to build everything that is possible to build on your
system.

In particular, the configure-script looks for the following:

- SQLite 3.x.x
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- wxWidgets
- A mono/C# compiler (for SWIG)
- Java (for SWIG)
- Python 2(for SWIG)
- Python 3 (for SWIG)
- PHP 7 (for SWIG)

These are controlled from the configure command line with
switches starting with --with.  For example:

--with-postgresql=[yes|no|maybe]

All of the switches (given below) at a minimum recognize these three
values.

- The value "yes" means, "yes, I do want this, and if it is not
possible to build on my system, then display an error message to that
effect, and do not complete the configure process."

- The value "no" means "No, I do not want to build Emdros with this
  enabled."

- The value "maybe" means "Let the configure script figure out whether
  it is possible to build it.  If it is possible, then build it, if
  not, then do not do so, and continue with the configure script."


The switches are as follows:

- SQLite 3.x.x        --with-sqlite3=[yes|no|maybe|local|system]
- PostgreSQL          --with-postgresql=[yes|no|maybe]
- MySQL               --with-mysql=[yes|no|maybe]
- wxWidgets           --with-wx=[yes|no|maybe]
- .Net (for SWIG)     --with-swig-language-csharp=[yes|no|maybe]
- Java (for SWIG)     --with-swig-language-java=[yes|no|maybe]
- Python 2 (for SWIG) --with-swig-language-python=[yes|no|maybe]
- Python 3 (for SWIG) --with-swig-language-python3=[yes|no|maybe]
- PHP7 (for SWIG)     --with-swig-language-php7=[yes|no|maybe]


--with-sqlite3
--------------

The SQLite switches are a little special, in that, in addition to the
[yes|no|maybe] values, they also take the two values "local" and
"system".

The value "local" means "yes, use SQLite (3), but use the locally 
present (i.e., in the Emdros sources) SQLite (3)".

The value "system" means "yes, use SQLite, but use the one installed
on the system", of the appropriate version.

The value "maybe" means "yes, use SQLite, and let the configure-script
choose whether to use the one on the system (if present) or the one in
the Emdros sources (if not present on the system)."

The value "yes" means the same as "maybe".

The value "no" means "do not build with SQLite (3)".


--with-bpt
----------

A backend exists, called BPT, which is much faster than SQLite, and
whose databases are much smaller than even SQLite 3's databases for
the same data.

The BPT backend is proprietary, and not part of the Open Source
version of Emdros.

The BPT backend comes with built-in, optional encryption.

If you are interested in licensing the BPT backend, please get in
touch with Ulrik Sandborg-Petersen, the author of Emdros, via email:
ulrikp@emergence.dk

The BPT engine is turned off by default, given that it is not part of
the Open Source version of Emdros.  In case you have the source code
and a license to it, you can enable it by:

1) Unpacking the source code for the BPT engine inside the Emdros
sources, overwriting all files.

2) Run configure:

  2a) If you are running Emdros < 3.3.1.pre21, run configure with the
  --with-bpt switch.

  2b) If you are running Emdros >= 3.3.1.pre21, merely running
  configure will pick up the fact that the BPT engine is present,
  provided you have unpacked the BPT sources correctly.


--with-bpt2
-----------

A backend exists, called BPT2, or BPT engine version 2.  BPT2 is much
faster than the BPT engine version 1, and the databases are much
smaller than even BPT version 1's databases for the same data.

The BPT2 backend is proprietary, and not part of the Open Source
version of Emdros.

The BPT2 backend comes with built-in, optional encryption.

If you are interested in licensing the BPT2 backend, please get in
touch with Ulrik Sandborg-Petersen, the author of Emdros, via email:
ulrikp@emergence.dk

The BPT2 engine is turned off by default, given that it is not part of
the Open Source version of Emdros.  In case you have the source code
and a license to it, you can enable it by:

1) Unpacking the source code for the BPT2 engine inside the Emdros
sources, overwriting all files.

2) Run configure.  Merely running configure will pick up the fact that
   the BPT2 engine is present, provided you have unpacked the BPT2
   sources correctly.




Building a package
------------------

If you need to build a package (e.g., on Solaris), here is the
procedure.  The following assumes that you want to install in
/opt/Emdros and build the package in /var/tmp/Emdros before
installing.  This is just an example.

1. ./configure --prefix=/opt/Emdros
2. make
3. mkdir /var/tmp/Emdros
4. make DESTDIR=/var/tmp/Emdros install
5. build package in /var/tmp/Emdros

This actually installs the Emdros files in /var/tmp/Emdros/opt/Emdros,
but builds the package in such a way that it assumes it is installed
in /opt/Emdros.







configure options 
=================

The most important ones are:

- --prefix=                  (defaults to /usr/local)
- --with-mysql=[yes|no|maybe]
- --with-postgresql=[yes|no|maybe]
- --with-sqlite3=[yes|no|maybe|system|local]
- --with-bpt=[yes|no|maybe]          (off by default)
- --with-bpt2=[yes|no|maybe]         (off by default)
- --with-wx=[yes|no|maybe]   (enables wxWidgets programs -- on by default if present on system)
- --enable-debug             (on by default)
- --disable-debug
- --enable-shared            (on by default)
- --disable-shared
- --enable-static            (on by default)
- --disable-static
- --enable-local-pcre        (on by default)
- --disable-local-pcre
- --with-swig-language-nodejs=[yes|no|maybe]
- --with-swig-language-java=[yes|no|maybe]
- --with-swig-language-python=[yes|no|maybe]
- --with-swig-language-python3=[yes|no|maybe]
- --with-swig-language-php7=[yes|no|maybe]
- --with-default-backend=[sqlite|sqlite3|mysql|postgresql]

For descriptions of these and other options, you can run the following
command:

  $ ./configure --help
