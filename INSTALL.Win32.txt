INSTALLING Emdros on Win32 platforms
====================================


Prebuilt binaries
-----------------

If you are using a version of Emdros for which binaries have been
released, it is easiest to use them.  If no binaries are provided, you
will have to compile Emdros yourself.


What does not currently work
----------------------------

The following are currently not supported on Windows:

- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- SWIG bindings


Compiling with Visual C++
-------------------------

Go to the win32 directory and read the README.txt file for
instructions on how to compile.


Post-installation docs
----------------------

After installation, please read the doc/HOW-TO-USE file.

Please also see the other documentation in the doc/ directory.
