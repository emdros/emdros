Release notes for Emdros 3.6.0
==============================

The release notes below cover some of the important changes in Emdros
since 3.5.0.

- SQLite2 support has been removed, as version 2 of SQLite has not
  been updated by the SQLite authors for many, many years.  Also,
  SQLite2 support in Emdros has been been deprecated for some time.

- The MQL subsystem has a better query planner, which is able to
  choose the "Innermost First" strategy, rather than the default
  "Outermost First" strategy, under many more circumstances.

- The Emdros MySQL backend now has support for transactions, if
  available in the MySQL server.

- Assorted performance improvements to the following subsystems:

  - XML parsing (renderobjects, for example)
  - MQL

- Node.JS support has been removed.  The reason is that the latest
  SWIG version (3.0.12) does not support the latest Node.  Also, the
  Node.JS bindings never really worked.

- PCRE has been upgraded.

- SQLite3 has been upgraded.

- JSON output now escapes string characters correctly.

- Compiling Linux .rpm packages works on recent systems (CentOS 7,
  Fedora 28).

- Compiling Linux .deb packages works on recent systems (Ubuntu 16.04,
  Ubuntu 18.04, Debian 9.4).

- Building on Windows supports the latest Visual Studio.

- Lots of compiler warnings have been removed.

- the harvest template language has new constructs:

  - {{ inccounter <string> var <string> }}
  - {{ deccounter <string> var <string> }}

- The Full Text Search FTS3 subsystem is now able to obey
  largest_proximity, and to use * and ? in the query terms.

- A new program was added, bptdetach(1), which enables detaching
  "payloads" from BPT databases.

- The BPT backend (if available -- ask Ulrik for the source code
  licensing terms if you are interested) now supports LZMA compression
  of payloads.

- Source code using wxWidgets has been updated to support wxWidgets
  2.8, 3.0, and 3.1.

- The Emdros PostgreSQL backend now adds "TEMPLATE template0" when
  doing CREATE DATABASE.  This is so as to avoid using template1,
  which may conflict with the encoding used (and does so on Debian
  9.4).

- The amalgamation output has been split into several files.  This is
  because the Android NDK MIPS target cannot compile the old,
  monolithic amalgamation files.



- *** Version 3.5.0 *** 

Release notes for Emdros 3.5.0
==============================

The focus-areas of this release include:

- Enhancements to the core MQL
- Bugfixes to the core MQL.
- Enhancements to the render library
- Enhancements to the Full Text Search subsystem
- Enhancements to SWIG bindings
- Enhancements to the build system

Please consult the ChangeLog (going back to version 3.4.1.pre01) for
the specifics.  You can also consult the MQL Programmer's Guide for
the enhancements to the core MQL, and the Programmer's Reference Guide
for the enhancements to the Render library and the FTS subsystem.

Briefly, the core MQL has been enhanced as follows:

- SELECT ALL OBJECTS has a new WITH MAX RANGE clause, helping to limit
  otherwise runaway queries such as [Word]..[Word].

- SELECT ALL OBJECTS now sports an [UnorderedGroup] block.

- GET AGGREGATE FEAUTURES is a new statement, similar to SQL's MIN(),
  MAX(), SUM(), and COUNT() aggregate functions.


- *** Version 3.4.0 ***

The focus-areas of this release include:

- Support for iOS and Android
- A smoother user experience for the GUI applications
- Enhancements to the MQL query language
- Documentation improvements
- Build improvements on all platforms
- Speed improvements


Binaries for Windows(R) and Mac OS X(R)
---------------------------------------

As usual, binaries are available for Mac OS X and Windows(R).

The Windows binaries are available in both x86 and x64 versions.  They
have built-in support for MySQL, SQLite 2, and SQLite 3.  The x86
binaries are built with Visual Studio Express 2010.  The x64 binaries
are built with Windows SDK 6.0A.

The Mac OS X binaries are Universal binaries (i386 and x86_64) running
on Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard), 10.7 (Lion), and 10.8 (Mountain
Lion), 10.9 (Mavericks), and possibly later versions of Mac OS X.
They do not have support for either MySQL or PostgreSQL; Only SQLite 2
and SQLite 3 are supported in the Mac OS X binaries.  You might be
able to compile the sources with support for MySQL yourself, and
possibly also PostgreSQL.

Linux binaries
--------------

For this release, we do not provide Linux binaries.  Instead, we have
ensured that it is easy to build .rpms and .debs from the sources.


To build an RPM or .deb, first install the dependencies mentioned in
the text file called "INSTALL" in the root of the sources.


A) To build an RPM:

rpmbuild -ta emdros-3.4.0.tar.gz


B) To build a .deb:

1) cp /path/to/Emdros/sources/emdros-3.4.0.tar.gz .

2) tar xfvz emdros-3.4.0.tar.gz

3) cd emdros-3.4.0

4) dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

This will build the .deb in ../.


Changes in more detail
----------------------

Release 3.4.0 has the following changes over 3.3.0:

- Build changes:

  - Support for compilation on Android and iOS were added.

  - Non-Unicode (ANSI) builds of the programs are no longer available
    on Windows.

  - On Linux / Unix / Mac OS X, wx/libemdrosguiu is now a static
    library.

  - Out-of-the-box support for building on Debian / Ubuntu /
    derivatives was added:

	$ tar xfzv emdros-x.y.z.tar.gz
	$ cd emdros-x.y.z
	$ dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot
	$ cd .. # The .deb package is in this directory
	$ sudo dpkg -i emdros_*.deb # This should install it.

  - The .pro build files for Qt have been updated to Qt 4.8.0, which
    entails dropping support for everything below Mac OS X 10.6 on Qt.

  - It is now possible to do Win64 builds on Windows.  See
    the very top of win32\config.mak for how to do it.

  - It is now possible to build Emdros on Windows with MinGW32,
    including support for wxWidgets.

  - Add a test suite which is run with "make test" in the root
    directory of the sources.

  - Much better configure.ac support for wxWidgets 2.8, 2.9, and 3.0,
    especially on Mac OS X.


- Harvest library changes:

  - Bugs were fixed
  - Speeds were increased
  - The template language was enhanced (see the docs)
  - A new Full Text Search engine, FTS2, was added.

- PHP was added as a supported SWIG binding.

- More support for feature-type "SET OF MONADS" was added:

  - Bugs were fixed
  - In topographic queries, it is now possible to say:

    SELECT ALL OBJECTS WHERE 
    [Clause 
        [Phrase
           // Could also be universe instead of substrate.
           // Could also be part_of instead of overlap.
           // part_of(monads, substrate) is still the default.
           overlap(mymonadsetfeature, substrate)
        ]
    ]

- The GET OBJECTS HAVING MONADS IN statement now supports using a
  different monad set than the default "monads" feature:

  GET OBJECTS HAVING MONADS IN
  { 2-40201, 40203-50000 }
  USING MONAD FEATURE described_SOM
  [Describer]
  GO

- Assorted speed increases in the EMdF / MQL libraries.

- The Penn Treebank converter output was improved.

- SQLite 3 was updated to version 3.8.4.3.

- Fixed a few documentation glitches


Enjoy!

- *** Version 3.3.0 *** 

As usual, binaries are available for Mac OS X, Windows(R), and Fedora
(15).  

The Windows binaries have support for MySQL, SQLite 2, and SQLite 3.
They are built with Visual Studio Express 2008.

The Mac OS X binaries are Universal binaries running on Mac OS X 10.4
(Tiger), 10.5 (Leopard), and 10.6 (Snow Leopard).  They do not have
support for either MySQL or PostgreSQL; Only SQLite 2 and SQLite 3 are
supported in the Mac OS X binaries.  You can compile the sources with
support for MySQL yourself, though, and possibly also PostgreSQL.

The Fedora binaries come with support for PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite 2,
and SQLite 3.

Release 3.3.0 has the following changes over 3.2.0:

- Experimental support for full text search was added (see manual
  pages fts_indexer(1) and fts_harvester(1)).

- The RenderObjects and RenderXML features of the harvest library were
  extended.

- General speed improvements were obtained.

- Support for building on recent Linux distributions was added.

- Support for building with Qt's qmake system was added.


The user should be advised that this is the last release which will
support Windows 98/ME.  In the next release, support for these
versions of Windws(R) will be dropped.

Enjoy!

The Fedora binaries come with support for PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite 2,
and SQLite 3.


This release has the following changes over 3.1.1:

- A new backend was created, called the BPT engine.  It is
  proprietary, and thus not Open Source, at the moment (sorry).
  Interested licensors can contact me at ulrikp - at - emdros |dot|
  org for questions about this new engine.

- SQLite3 was upgraded to version 3.6.17

- PCRE was upgraded to version 8.01. The license is still BSD.

- The TIGERXML importer is now more lenient towards the XML being
  imported.

- The Emdros Query Tool now implements an XML_Output_Style.  See the
  User's Guide for the Emdros Query Tool for how to use it.  WARNING:
  The output is still subject to change!

- The Emdros Query Tool (GUI version) can now create PNG files right
  from the command line.  See the man page for eqtu.

- Assorted changes to the harvest library.  Note that the harvest
  library is not stable yet; all APIs are subject to change as I
  experiment with the best way of doing this important task.

- A topographic query can be stopped by setting the following bool to
  false:

  MQLExecEnv::m_bContinueExecution.

- Assorted changes to the horizontal tree and vertical tree layout
  engines.

Enjoy!

- *** Version 3.1.1 *** 

This release has the following changes over 3.1.0:

Bugfixes
--------

- PHP bindings were removed, since they were broken.  If anyone needs
  them, please email the author.

- The Mac distribution now installs eqtc in bin/ rather than
  development/bin.

- When printing sheaves as "kOKConsole" (console output), feature
  values that are lists of either integers or enums are now printed as
  "(X,Y,Z)" rather than "(,X,Y,Z,)".

- Bugfixes were made to the -- still unofficial! -- libharvest.

- SWIG was told to free the memory returned by the following:

	  - EmdrosEnv::takeOverResult
	  - EmdrosEnv::takeOverSheaf
	  - EmdrosEnv::takeOverFlatSheaf
	  - EmdrosEnv::takeOverTable
	  - EmdrosEnv::takeOverStatement

	  The lack of this might have caused memory leaks before, when
	  using Emdros via one of the SWIG bindings.


Build changes
-------------

- Added support for gcc 4.4 (e.g., Fedora 11, Ubuntu 9.04).

- Added support for wxWidgets 2.9.X (wxWidgets testing).

- Removed support for wxWidgets 2.6.


Enhancements
------------

- SQLite was upgraded to 3.6.12.

- TECkit was upgraded to version 2.5.1.

- The default behavior of SQLite2 and SQLite3 is now to use in-memory
  storage for temp storage.

- EQT now shows the full pathname to the current query in the title
  bar.

- StringList now has a new API: std::vector<std::string>
  StringList::getAsVector(void) const.

- All SWIG bindings now wrap std::vector<std::string> as StringVector.
  This can be used in conjunction with the above API addition to
  StringList.

- IntegerList now has a new API: std::vector<long> getAsVector(void)
  const;

- All SWIG bindings now wrap std::vector<int> as IntVector.

- The libharvest library continues to move forward.  If anyone is
  interested in using it, please let the author know.


Enjoy!


Ulrik Sandborg-Petersen




- *** Version 3.1.0 *** 

This release has the following changes over 3.0.1:

Bug fixes
---------

- The long-standing bug, #1217003 on SourceForge.Net's Emdros bug
  tracker, has been fixed.  Basically, there was a design error in the
  way object references were handled in topographic MQL.  This could
  sometimes lead to misleading and/or incomplete results.

- Bug #2021303 has been fixed.  It said that in the Emdros Query Tool,
  setting "option = quiet" in the config file would entail that one
  had to resize the window to get any output displayed at all.



Feature enhancements
--------------------

- The Emdros Query Tool is now able to save its output to HTML.  When
  the output contains trees, they are saved as PNGs.

- Added an unofficial libharvest, which is a library for "harvesting"
  Emdros objects.  The documentation is currently incomplete, and the
  API and template language are still subject to change.  Please
  contact the author if you are interested in using this.

- Added a JSON parser, used in libharvest.

- The Emdros Query Tool now doesn't display any tool tips, which users
  wanted turned off.

- Object reference usages can now reference its own block.  For
  example, this is now possible:

  [Word as w1 
      // Note how this references the same object for both features.
      phrase_dependent_part_of_speech = w1.part_of_speech
  ]

- On Linux desktops, menu entries are added for the Emdros Query Tool,
  the Emdros Chunking Tool, and the Emdros Import Tool.

- The Emdros Query Tool and the Emdros Chunking Tool are both
  significantly faster at displaying results.

- The Emdros Query Tool is now able to display horizontal trees in its
  output.

- The Emdros Query Tool is now able to output results as a KWIC
  concordance (KWIC = Keywords In Context).

- MatchedObject::getFeatureAsString() now returns a list of enum
  labels rather than a list of integers when the feature is a list of
  enums.

- The speed of GET OBJECTS HAVING MONADS IN has been improved.

- The TigerXML importer now is able to import *.ltcx files from
  Linguistic Tree Constructor.



Build changes
-------------

- gcc 4.3 is now supported.

- PostgreSQL version 8.3 is now the only supported version, on all
  platforms.

- Emdros can now be rpm-built on 64-bit Fedora 10.

- Emdros can now be built on x86 Solaris.

- RPMs now get the distribution identifier (e.g., fc9) in the RPM name
  automatically.

- Python SWIG DLL on Win32 is now called _Emdros.pyd rather than
  _Emdros.dll.

- On Mac OS X, both 10.4 and 10.5 are supported by the same binaries.

- wxWidgets 2.4 and 2.6 are no longer supported; only 2.8 and 2.9.X
  are.

- On Mac OS X and Linux/Unix, non-Unicode builds of Emdros are no
  longer supported.

- SWIG csharp is now able to use GMCS for .Net bindings.




Enjoy!

1) You should upgrade your databases
====================================

The current version of Emdros uses a more efficient way of storing
object and monad data, leading to speed improvements when creating
objects.  Also, a new way of storing strings has been introduced, and
a new way of obtaining SEQUENCE_OTHER id_ds has been made.

These changes lead to incompatibility between older versions of Emdros
and this version.  Old versions cannot read this version's databases,
and this version can't read old databases.

This means, you should upgrade any old databases.

NOTE that this CANNOT be done with the upgrade_db tool.  Instead, you
must dump your databases with the mqldump tool and reload it using the
mql program of the current version.  For example (on Linux):

$ mqldump --no-create-db --verbose --password changeme -o mydb.mql mydb
$ echo "CREATE DATABASE mydbnew" | mql --password changeme
$ mql --dbname mydbnew --password changeme mydb.mql

Note that this cannot be done with the mqldump of the present version,
since it cannot read old databases.  Therefore, you must use mqldump
from whatever version you are presently running to dump the data, and
then use mql from this version to reload.


2) Big name change
==================

There has been a big namechange (as of 1.2.0.pre78), where many class
names, method names, constant names, and other identifiers have been
renamed.  This was done automatically with a sed script, which you
will find in the ChangeLog for September 11, 2004.  You will need to
run this sed script on your sources before you can compile your
application against this version of Emdros.

The reason for this big name change was that I had long wished for a
harmonization into Java-style conventions, and for a simplification of
certain long identifiers.  Now seemed as good a time as any.  I posted
a question to the Emdros Open Discussion Forum about it, asking for
people's comments.  No-one said they didn't like it, and lots of
people said they did.

If you need help with converting your sources, please write to me:

http://emdros.org/contact.html

and I will try to point you in the right direction.


3) Segment support removed
==========================

Support for segments have been removed.  This is because segments were
a broken concept all along, and I have long wished to remove it.  I
have replaced segments with the new notion of "arbitrary monad sets."

Changes:

- The CREATE SEGMENT statement now creates a monad set instead of a
  segment.

- The SELECT SEGMENTS and DROP SEGMENT statements have been removed.

- The USING SEGMENTS clause has been removed from statements that do
  topographic queries.

- mqldump can no longer dump segments, and the appropriate
  command-line switches have been removed.


4) Arbitrary monad sets
=======================

Segments have been replaced with "arbitrary monad sets".  An arbitrary
monad set is a set of monads that does not have any associated object
(that is, it has no object type, and no features).

The new statements associated with arbitrary monad sets are:

- CREATE MONAD SET
- UPDATE MONAD SET
- DROP MONAD SET
- SELECT MONAD SETS
- GET MONAD SETS

The SELECT (ALL|FOCUS) OBJECTS statement now has new syntax so that
the IN clause can use arbitrary monad sets:

CREATE MONAD SET My_book_collection
WITH MONADS = { 1-23500, 24400-27900 }
GO

SELECT ALL OBJECTS
IN My_book_collection
WHERE
[blah blah blah]
GO


5) Enum changes
===============

Changes have occurred in how enumerations are handled.

a) Enumeration constants must now be unique in their values as well as
   their labels.  Before, you could have two labels with the same
   value.  Now values must be distinct within an enumeration.  This
   effectively makes an enumeration a bijection (or one-to-one
   correspondence) between a set of labels and a set (having the same
   size) of values.

   The rationale for this change was that it was desirable to return
   labels rather than values from, e.g., GET FEATURES.  For this to
   happen, there must be a one-to-one correspondence between labels
   and values.

b) GET FEATURES now returns labels rather than values for enumeration
   features.


6) EMdF value changes
=====================

Support has been added (as of 1.2.0.pre152) for:

- lists of INTEGER
- lists of ID_D
- lists of enumeration constants


This is reflected in the following statements:

- CREATE OBJECT TYPE
- UPDATE OBJECT TYPE
- CREATE OBJECT
- UPDATE OBJECT
- CREATE OBJECTS WITH OBJECT TYPE
- GET OBJECTS HAVING MONADS IN
- GET FEATURES
- SELECT FEATURES
- SELECT (ALL|FOCUS) OBJECTS


7) Statement changes
====================

A number of new statements were added:

- BEGIN TRANSACTION
- COMMIT TRANSACTION
- ABORT TRANSACTION
- DROP INDEXES
- CREATE INDEXES
- CREATE MONAD SET
- UPDATE MONAD SET
- DROP MONAD SET
- SELECT MONAD SETS
- GET MONAD SETS
- CREATE OBJECTS WITH OBJECT TYPE
- GET SET FROM FEATURE

These are all described in the MQL User's Guide in chapter 3.  The
transaction statements have a section of their own, while the index
statements are under "database manipulation".

The VACUUM DATABASE statement now works on MySQL as well.

CREATE OBJECTS WITH OBJECT TYPE is a convenient and speedy way of
batch-importing large numbers of objects.

These statements were removed:

- SELECT SEGMENTS
- DROP SEGMENT

USING SEGMENTS has been removed from SELECT (ALL|FOCUS) OBJECTS.

CREATE/USE/DROP DATABASE can now take a T_STRING in addition to a
T_IDENTIFIER for its database name. On MySQL and PostgreSQL, it must
still be a valid identifier, even when a string is given.  However, on
SQLite, this means you can give the full path to the database
filename, as well as non-identifier database names.


8) Topographic changes
======================

Introduction
------------

The SELECT (ALL|FOCUS) OBJECTS statement now has the following new
features:

- You can GET features into the sheaf (see the next section).
- feature-constraints support a new IN comparison operator.
- There is a new "BETWEEN X AND Y" restrictor for power blocks.
- There is now a NOTEXIST operator before object blocks
- There is now a "Kleene Star" operator after object blocks
- There is a new IN comparison operator for feature comparisons
- There is a new HAS comparison operator for feature comparisons


GET in object blocks
--------------------

You can now place a GET clause inside of an object_block(_first),
between the feature constraints and the optional inner blocks.  E.g.:

SELECT ALL OBJECTS
WHERE
[Phrase
  phrase_type = NP
  GET function
  [Word
    psp = noun and number = singular
    GET lexeme, gender
  ]
]


The list after GET is a comma-separated list of feature names from the
object type of the object block.  As can be seen, the list is not
terminated by any explicit token.

The values will get into the sheaf, from where you can obtain them
with the API provided on the MatchedObject.  See the Emdros
Programmer's Reference Guide on the Emdros website for more
information:

http://emdros.org/docs.html


New IN comparator
-----------------

The IN-comparison operator compares an enumeration-feature with a list
of enumeration constants, an integer-feature with a list of integers,
or an id_d feature with a list of id_ds.

For enumeration constants, it looks like this:

SELECT ALL OBJECTS
WHERE
[Word part_of_speech IN (verb, participle, infinitive)]
GO

It has the same effect as:

SELECT ALL OBJECTS
WHERE
[Word part_of_speech = verb
   OR part_of_speech = participle
   OR part_of_speech = infinitive]
GO

Thus the effect is the same as a string of "=" comparisons with OR in
between.

The right-hand-side can also be a list of integers or id_ds, or even
an object reference usage:

SELECT ALL OBJECTS
WHERE
[Clause AS c1
   [Phrase 
      number IN (1,2,3)
      OR self IN (1,2,3)
      OR self IN c1.descendants
   ]
]

See Chapter 4 of the MQL User's Guide for more information.


New HAS operator
----------------

This is used like this:

SELECT ALL OBJECTS
WHERE
[Clause AS c1
   [Phrase // Phrase.parents is a list of id_ds
           parents HAS c1.self 

           // Phrase.functions is a list of enum constants
           OR functions HAS Subject 

           // numbers is a list of integers
           OR numbers HAS 37
   ] 
]

in other words, the left-hand-side must be a list-of-something, and
the right-hand-side must either be an atomic value (but not a string
or ascii value), or an object reference usage that resolves to an
atomic value (but not a string or ascii value).


New way of doing power restrictors
----------------------------------

A new way of doing restrictions on power blocks ("..") has been added.
You can now do:

[foo]
.. BETWEEN 1 AND 3
[bar]

to get bars that are separated by from 1 to 3 monads (inclusive).
Thus if you have five "bar" objects, one at each of the monads 1, 2,
3, 4, and 5, and one foo object at monad 1, then the above query would
return three straws with two objects: The first object in each straw
would be the foo object at monad 1.  The second would be one of the
bar objects at monad 3, 4, or 5.  This is because there is 1 monad
between the foo object at monad 1 and the bar object at monad 3, and
three monads between the foo object at monad 1 and the bar object at
monad 5.  Thus there are from 1 to three monads in between the two
objects.

Note that this means that

[foo]
.. <= 3
[bar]

is equivalent to

[foo]
.. BETWEEN 0 AND 3
[bar]

whereas

[foo]
.. < 3
[bar]

is equivalent to

[foo]
.. BETWEEN 0 AND 2
[bar]

This is what the interpretation of ".. < integer" and ".. <= integer"
has been for quite a while.

Thus what is counted is monads that can separate the two, or monads in
bewteen.  This is not counting the monad that starts the bar object.


NOTEXIST operator
-----------------

A new NOTEXIST operator was introduced (in 1.2.0.pre106) which allows
searching for things that do not exist:

SELECT ALL OBJECTS
WHERE
[Sentence
   NOTEXIST [Word lexeme="see"]
]
GO

This finds all sentences in which a word with the lexeme "see" does
not exist.


Kleene Star operator
--------------------

A new Kleene Star operator was introduced (in 1.2.0.pre117) which
allows searching for object blocks that are repeated.  It has two
forms: One with and one without a trailing set of integers (with the
same syntax as a set of monads).  For example:

SELECT ALL OBJECTS
WHERE
[Sentence
  [Phrase FIRST phrase_type = NP]
  [Phrase phrase_type IN (VP, NP, AP)]*
  [Phrase function = adjunct]* {1-3}
]
GO

This finds sentences whose first phrase is an NP, followed by
arbitrarily many phrases which can either be VPs, NPs, or APs (or any
combination of those), followed by between 1 and 3 phrases whose
function is adjunct.

A less contrived example:

SELECT ALL OBJECTS
WHERE
[Sentence
  [Word psp=verb]
  [Word psp=article or psp=noun or psp=adjective or psp=conjunction]*{1-5}
]
GO

This finds sentences where there exists a word whose part of speech is
verb, followed by 1 to 5 words whose parts of speech may be article,
noun, adjective, or conjunction (or any combination of those).
Presumably this would (in English) be a VP with (parts of) the object
NP after the verb.

The Kleene-Star without a trailing set of integers means "from 0 to
MAX_MONADS".  Note, however, that there is no performance penalty
involved in such a large end: The algorithm stops looking when getting
getting one more fails.

If 0 is in the set of integers, then this means that the object need
not be there. This means that the following:

SELECT ALL OBJECTS
WHERE
[Sentence
  [Word psp=verb]
  [Word psp=article]*{0-1}
  [Word psp=noun]
]
GO

would find sentences where there exists a verb followed by 0 or 1
articles followed by a noun.  Thus the case of "verb immediately
followed by noun" would also be found by this query.  Thus the
"*{0-1}" is equivalent to "?" in regular expressions.

The following restrictions apply:

- You cannot have the Kleene star on the first object block in a
string of blocks, nor can you have it on the first after a power block
("..").

- You cannot have a Kleene Star on an object block which also has the
  NOTEXIST keyword in front.

- You cannot have a Kleene Star on an object block which has the
  "noretrieve" keyword.



9) Features in the sheaf
========================

You can now get features into the sheaf.  For example:

SELECT ALL OBJECTS
WHERE
[verse
   book = Genesis chapter = 2 and verse = 1
   GET verse_label
   [word 
      GET surface_consonants, old_lexeme, psp
   ]
]
go

As can be seen, the GET clause occurs inside of an object block after
all feature comparisons.  It is followed by a comma-separated list of
feature-names to be gotten.  Their values are then put in the
matched_object.

See the MatchedObject API for how to get them out again.

The XML DTD for sheaves has changed to accomodate the new addition.
Also, console output will have additional information if there is a
GET clause.


10) Monads of a sheaf
====================

The Sheaf class now has two new methods, both called getSOM, which
extract the monads of a sheaf.  This is done recursively.  A boolean
says whether to only use matched_objects whose focus boolean is true,
or all matched_objects.


11) Regexes
===========

Regexes are no longer anchored.  This means that, e.g.,

  [Object_type feature ~ "H"]

will now find values for feature such as "!H!", "ALOHA" and "THE".
Before, it would only have found "H".


12) Functions with new interfaces
=================================

A number of functions have new signatures.  If you use any of these
functions, you should update your program to use the new signatures.

The functions whose signatures have changed are:

- CMQLResult::Print()
- All of the put_XML/put_Console members of the sheaf family of
  classes.
- CMatched_object::getObjectTypeName()

You can look these up in the Programmer's Reference Guide, available online:

http://emdros.org/progref/current/

or you can see the code itself.


13) SWIG changes
================

- You no longer need SWIG installed if you simply wish to compile from
  source.  This is both on Windows and on Unix/Linux.  This is
  possible because the SWIG'ified Emdros sources are pre-built and
  shipped with the Emdros sources.  Then at compile-time, the right
  version is selected based on your choice of database backend(s).

- If you wish to develop Emdros, you must now use SWIG 1.3.31 or
  later.

- The SWIG Java wrappers are now in a package called jemdros.  This
  means that you must "import jemdros.*" or the like in your Java
  programs.  See the TestEmdros.java program for an example.

- Support has been added for PHP.

- Support has been added for C#.


14) PostgreSQL privileges of the emdf user
==========================================

In previous releases, the doc/bootstrapping.txt file said that the
PostgreSQL emdf user should be given permission to create databases,
but need not be given permission to create users.

I have since found that this creates problems when vacuuming a
database from within Emdros.  The specific warning message is:

WARNING:  Skipping "pg_group" --- only table or database owner can VACUUM it
WARNING:  Skipping "pg_shadow" --- only table or database owner can VACUUM it
WARNING:  Skipping "pg_database" --- only table or database owner can VACUUM it

This is because the emdf user is not a superuser.  To be a PostgreSQL
superuser, it must be given both the privilege to create databases and
the privilege to create users.  If it has not, I recommend that you
start the psql program as the postgres user (or any other superuser),
and issue the following command:

alter user emdf with createdb createuser;


15) emdf database no longer needed
==================================

As of 1.2.0.pre52, the emdf database is no longer needed on PostgreSQL
and MySQL.  The bootstrapping.txt document has been updated to reflect
this.

SQLite has never needed an emdf database.


16) Required PostgreSQL version
===============================

As of 1.2.0.pre142, Emdros requires PostgreSQL 7.3 or later on
Linux/Unix, while PostgreSQL 8.0 or later is required on Win32.


17) Build procedure changes
===========================

More than one backend in a single binary
----------------------------------------

As of 1.2.0.pre212, it is possible to have support for more than one
database backend in the same binary.  This means that command-line
programs now have a new switch [-b backend|--backend backend] for
selecting the right backend.


No pgemdf and mysqlemdf libraries
---------------------------------

The backend-specific emdf libraries have been moved into the emdf
library.  Therefore, you should not specify the pgemdf or mysqlemdf
libraries in your build procedure.


Specifying the backend
----------------------

If building from source on Linux/Solaris, the configure script must
now be given one (or more) of the following switches:

  --with-postgresql
  --with-mysql
  --with-sqlite
  --with-sqlite3

If building on Win32, please see the new the instructions for
selecting the right backend (see win32/README.txt).


Solaris changes
---------------

As of 1.2.0.pre76, the algorithm in configure.in to find SUNWSPRO_PATH
has been changed.  It is now found as follows:

      SUNWSPRO_PATH=`which $CXX | sed -e 's:/bin/CC::'`

If this does not work for you, please contact me via:

http://emdros.org/contact.html



18) Missing #include's?
=======================

The #include-structure has been changed somewhat.  This means that you
may need to #include more files than you usually do.

Here are some files you may need to #include *before*
<emdros_environment.h>:

#include <emdf_output.h>
#include <monads.h>
#include <emdfdb.h>
#include <mql_symboltable.h>

If you #included <emdros-version.h> (you shouldn't; it's #included in
emdf.h), you should either #include <emdf.h> or #include
<version-emdros.h>.


19) Support for DJGPP
=====================

As of 1.2.0.pre74, UNOFFICIAL support has been added for DJGPP.  Only
SQLite is implemented as a backend.  That the support is UNOFFICIAL
means that I may not maintain it across releases, and only update when
I need it myself after things get broken.  

However, if you need support for DJGPP in a particular release, feel
free to contact me through one of the means provided at:

http://emdros.org/contact.html

And I *may* provide what you need.  No promises, though.

Patches are welcome as always.



Enjoy!

- *** Version 1.1.23 *** Released 2006-08-16

1) Introduction
===============

This is a bugfix release.  It fixes bugs 1285197 and 1122024.


2) Bug 1285197
==============

Title: Can have object ref. usage on same object block (1.1)

It was possible to have an object reference usage which references the
same object block as that in which it is found.

SELECT ALL OBJECTS 
WHERE
[Clause AS c1 self = c1.self]

This has been fixed at the Symbol stage.


3) Bug 1122024 
==============

Title: Empty database will throw BadMonadsException on SELECT

The following script would trigger the error:

CREATE DATABASE testemdf5 GO
USE DATABASE testemdf5 GO
CREATE OBJECT TYPE [Word surface : ASCII;] GO
SELECT ALL OBJECTS WHERE [Word surface = "bob"]GO
DROP DATABASE testemdf5 GO

The problem was in mql_select_statements.cpp when getting All_m_1, if
the database was empty, a BadMonadsException was thrown because MIN_M
was MAX_MONADS, and MAX_M was 0, thus a monad set was attempted
generated which had MAX_MONADS (around 2 billion) as its first monad
and 0 as its last monad.

This has been fixed.


4) Documentation
================

The documentation which used to be packaged separately is now included
in the doc/ directory, as well as in the RPMs.



- *** Version 1.1.22 *** Released February 8, 2005

1) Introduction
===============

This is a security-related bugfix release.  It fixes bug 1116935,
available in the bugtracker on http://sf.net/projects/emdros, as well
as below.

Basically, if you fed the MQL parser some malformed MQL, then it
would, in many cases, leak memory.  This could lead to a Denial of
Service (DoS) attack if a user with local access fed the mql(1) binary
large quantities of malformed MQL.  The machine would consume more and
more memory, until it slowed almost to a grinding halt.

This has been fixed by substituting the bison parser for a lemon-based
parser.  Lemon is part of the SQLite package, available from
http://www.sqlite.org/.  Lemon has the distinct advantage of having
the concept of a "destructor" on both terminals and non-terminals.
This has been employed so that the new parser automatically takes care
of cleaning up after a syntax error.


2) Bug 1116935
==============

http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1116935&group_id=37219&atid=419458

The MQL parser will leak memory if given certain kinds of malformed
MQL statements. This can lead to a DoS attack with more and more
memory being consumed. The vulnerability is normally only exploitable
if a user has local access. However, if MQL is run as a service
through xinetd or similar, it is also exploitable remotely.

All platforms are affected: Windows, Linux, Solaris.

However, I have confirmed that the fixed version leaks no
memory on any of these systems.

This is a bugfix release.  It fixes bugs 965756, 973796, 981648,
981653, and 981660, all available in the bugtracker on
SourceForge.net:

Also, this release sees better support for compiling on Solaris, and
slightly better handling of PostgreSQL.  See the ChangeLog for
details.


Following are summaries of the reported bugs.


2) Bug 965756
=============

Subj: CREATE OBJECT WITH ID_D fails on PostgreSQL

There is a bug in 1.1.19 which causes CREATE OBJECT WITH ID_D to fail
under some circumstances on PostgreSQL. The problem is that the
function

PgEMdFDB::SetNextObjectID_DIfNotHigher(id_d_t next_id_d)

uses currval('sequence_118_0') when the current session has no value
defined, because nextval has not been called. See the PostgreSQL
documentation:

file:///usr/share/doc/postgresql/html/functions-sequence.html



3) Bug 973796
=============

Subj: Invalid monad-range in SELECT ALL OBJECTS throws exception

If one uses a monad range in a SELECT ALL OBJECTS query which is
outside of the monads in the database, a BadMonadsException is thrown.

For example, if a database only has objects with monads 1-4, the
following would throw the exception:

SELECT ALL OBJECTS
IN {10-15}
[OT]
GO

Expected behavior: To return a failed sheaf.



4) Bug 981648
=============

Subj: UPDATE OBJECT TYPE segfaults if no CBBFList


UPDATE OBJECT TYPE segfaults if the list of Covered By / Buildable
From additions/removals is empty.

For example

UPDATE OBJECT TYPE
[Word
  ADD lemma : STRING;
]

would segfault.  I guess that functionality hasn't been tested in
years.  The mqltry(1) program tests it, but until this bug was found
had a CBBFList at the end.



5) Bug 981653
=============

Subj: UPDATE OBJECT TYPE fails to set default value

UPDATE OBJECT TYPE doesn't set the new feature-column's default value
when ADDing a feature. For example:

UPDATE OBJECT TYPE
[Word
  ADD lemma : STRING DEFAULT "<lemma not set>";
  ADD psp : psp_t DEFAULT psp_NotAppliccable;
  ADD word_index : INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
  ADD id_up : ID_D DEFAULT NIL;
]

In all of these additions, the new column in OT_objects should be set
to the default value. This does not happen on PostgreSQL and
MySQL. What is even worse, on MySQL, NULL is inserted if the feature
is a STRING or an ASCII.


6) Bug 981660
=============

Subj: Malformed CREATE/UPDATE OBJECT TYPE code could lead to DOS

There is a memory leak in CFeatureDeclaration::TypeTypeCompatibility()
which could lead to a Denial of Service (DOS) attack if mql were run
as a service/xinitd service, by issuing enough malformed CREATE OBJECT
TYPE or UPDATE OBJECT TYPE statements.

- *** Version 1.1.19 *** Released May 29, 2004

1) Introduction
===============

This is a bugfix release.  It fixes bugs 939028, 941033, 941076, and
945820, all available in the bugtracker on SourceForge.Net:

http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=939028&group_id=37219&atid=419458

http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=945820&group_id=37219&atid=419458

There are also assorted other bugfixes, but these are the most
important ones.  The others were so inconsequential as not to warrant
bug reports.  See the ChangeLog for details.

Following are summaries of the reported bugs.


2) Bug 939028
=============

Subj: DELETE OBJECTS BY MONADS can cause monad corruption

The statement

DELETE OBJECT BY MONADS = { ... } [OT]

can cause objects' monads to be partially deleted, even if the object
itself is not deleted.

The problem is that rows are deleted from the OT_monad_ms table based
on mse_first/mse_last. This is not reliable because an object could
have some MSEs inside the monad set to be deleted, while also having
some MSEs outside of the set. Then the MSEs inside the set would get
erronerously deleted, whereas the MSES outside the set would not. The
object itself would not get deleted, because the
first_monad/last_monad columns are used to delete the objects from
OT_objects.

This all happens in EMdFDB::DropObjectsInMonads().


3) Bug 941033
=============

Subj: DELETE OBJECTS BY MONADS can cause min_m to be 0

There is a bug in EMdFDB::Set_min_max_m_from_object_type() which can
cause min_m to be set to 0 if the object type in question has no
objects.

This is a problem, e.g., when calling DELETE OBJECTS BY MONADS, or
DELETE OBJECTS BY ID_DS and there is at least one object type which
does not contain any objects.

This is on PostgreSQL. MySQL is not affected.


4) Bug 941076
=============

Subj: Feature cache not used

There is a bug in EMdFDB::add_feature_to_cache_if_not_already_there():
The logic only adds if it is there already, not if it is not there.

This means that the cache is never filled, since this function is the
only entry point used for adding features to the cache.

Note that this is not a correctness problem, since the cache always
remains empty.  It is only a performance problem, as the cache cannot
be used.



5) Bug 945820
=============

Subj: CREATE OBJECT WITH ID_D doesn't update sequence

If one issues a

CREATE OBJECT
FROM MONADS = {...}
WITH ID_D = 10200 // this is not NIL or absent
[blah blah]

then sequence_118_0 doesn't get updated.

This means, e.g., that if one uses mqldump to dump a database, and
then loads that database again, then sequence_118_0 will still be at
10000. Thus, when attempting to create a new object, a sequence number
will be drawn which exists already, and the object cannot be created.

This is quite serious.

Note that this bug also exists prior to 1.1.18, although it is unknown
how far back.

- *** Version 1.1.18 *** Released April 17, 2004

1) Introduction

This is a bugfix release.  It fixes a memory leak in the lexer. The
bug was fixed by reverting back from Flex 2.5.31 to Flex 2.5.4.  

The only functional change is that manage_indices and upgrade_db now
don't connect to the "emdf" database before connecting to the database
to be managed or upgraded.  This is useful if, for some reason, you
don't have the emdf database, or can't create it.


Enjoy!

- *** Version 1.1.17 *** Released April 5, 2004

1) Introduction

This is a bugfix release.  It fixes a bug whereby SheafIterator and
SheafConstIterator would segfault when created from a failed
sheaf. 

Also, the iterators' hasNext() methods now play nice with iterators
which are from a failed sheaf, returning false unconditionally if the
mother sheaf was a failed sheaf.

This means that you can now always create a (const) iterator from a
sheaf, then test with hasNext() whether there are any straws to get.
Simple as that.


Enjoy!

- *** Version 1.1.16 *** Released March 24, 2004

1) Introduction

This is a compatibility release.  It adds support for:

- Debian woody (i.e., gcc 2.95)
- Debian sid (i.e., flex after 2.5.4a)
- SWIG 1.3.21

The only functionality change is that regexes are no longer anchored.
This means that regexes no longer match only from the beginning of the
string, but from anywhere in the string.


Enjoy!

Ulrik Petersen



- *** Version 1.1.15 *** Released March 6, 2004

1) Introduction

This is a bugfix release. It fixes a nasty bug whereby topographic
query results would potentially not be correct if the query involved
at least one standard SQL comparison (=, <>, >, <, >=, <=) on an
atomic value, AND either a regexp comparison or a comparison on an
object reference.  For example, the following two queries did not
retrieve the correct results before:


SELECT ALL OBJECTS
IN { 1-11 }
WHERE
[Word as w1 psp = preposition]
.. < 5
[Word psp = conjunction or psp = w1.psp ]
GO


SELECT ALL OBJECTS
IN { 1-11 }
WHERE
[Word NOT (psp <> conjunction AND lexeme !~ ">T") ]
GO

News in brief:

1) Introduction

2) Feedback


1) Introduction
===============

This is a bugfix release with small feature enhancements.  

Bugs fixed:

B1) A minor bug was fixed whereby a query would not be executed if it
    started with whitespace and had no GO at the end.

B2) The hexadecimal and octal conversions in the MQL lexer for
    "double-quoted strings" (like "\xa0" and "\377") did not
    work. This has been fixed.

B3) The UPDATE OBJECT TYPE statement did not commit the transaction it
    started.  It does now.


And the enhancements:

E1) GET FEATURES is now faster, especially with many ID_Ds, since the
    symbol stage no longer checks whether the ID_Ds exist.

E2) SELECT OBJECTS HAVING MONADS IN is now faster if there are more
    than 100 monad-ranges.

News in brief:

1) Introduction

2) Feedback


1) Introduction
===============

This is a bugfix release.  It fixes one major bug whereby one couldn't
search for STRING features with =, <, >, <=, >=, or <> in a SELECT ALL
OBJECTS query.  ASCII features worked fine, but not STRINGS.

- *** Version 1.1.12 *** Released 7/7-2003

News in brief:

1) Introduction

2) Enumeration constants are now case-sensitive

3) Less memory consumption and other speed improvements

4) You may need to #include <iostream>

5) Feedback


1) Introduction
===============

This release is mostly about enumerations and speed improvements.
More on both below.


2) Enumeration constants are now case-sensitive
===============================================

Before release 1.1.12, enumeration constants were not case-sensitive.
This should come as no surprise, since the MQL User's Guide plainly
said so.  However, this proved to be a problem for one of my users.
Therefore, this release brings full case-sensitivity to enumeration
constants.  

In addition, a number of bugs concerning enumerations have been fixed.
See the ChangeLog for details.


3) Less memory consumption and other speed improvements
=======================================================

This release sees about 7% speed increase on MySQL and 14% speed
increase on PostgreSQL (at least on my machine).  This is mainly due
to Emdros now using less memory.

In addition, several other speedups were made.  See the ChangeLog for
details.


4) You may need to #include <iostream>
======================================

This release rearranges the way <iostream> is #include'd.  It is no
longer #include'ed in any Emdros .h files.  Therefore, if you
previously relied on it being #include'ed in an Emdros .h file, you
may need to add it to your C++ source file.


5) Feedback
===========

Please send comments, suggestions, criticism, etc. to

ulrikp at users.sourceforge.net

- *** Version 1.1.11 *** Released June 10, 2003

News in brief:

1) Introduction

2) No more SWIG RPMs

3) Enhancements

4) SWIG changes

5) Changes to the build procedure

6) Questions? Problems? Success-stories?




1) Introduction
===============

This release brings a lot of bugfixes and enhancements, as well as
other changes.  Below we detail some of these.  The full list can be
found in the ChangeLog.


2) No more SWIG RPMs
====================

SWIG is the "Simplified Wrapper Interface Generator", for wrapping C
and C++ for use with scripting languages.  SWIG is available from
www.swig.org.  Emdros supports SWIG bindings for Java, Perl, Python,
and Ruby.

There hasn't been much interest in the SWIG RPMs for Linux.
Therefore, they will not be made available for download until further
notice.  

If you need SWIG RPMs, you can try and build them yourself.  Try "make
spec2" after configure, which produces .spec files with support for
SWIG RPMs.  You may need to edit the .spec file if you don't want RPMs
for all of the four supported languages.

Alternatively, you can write me and complain :-).  I can be reached
via:

http://emdros.org/contact.html


3) Enhancements
===============

The enhancements come in three categories:

- Speed improvements
- API improvements
- program improvements


Speed improvements
------------------

A lot of speed improvements have surfaced in this release.  

- One dramatic one was an improvement in the way PgEMdFConnection and
  MySQLEMdFConnection fetched data from the backend.  This resulted in
  an across-the-board speed increase of about 30% on PostgreSQL and
  50% on MySQL.

- Topographic queries using object references will see speed
  improvements.

- SELECT OBJECTS HAVING MONADS IN now scales well to thousands of
  object id_ds.  This was slow on PostgreSQL before.


API improvements
----------------

a) CEmdrosEnv:

There is a new CEmdrosEnv (Emdros environment) class which makes life
easier for application-programmers who use Emdros to build their
application.  See the API description online in the Emdros
Programmer's Reference Guide:

http://emdros.org/progref/page.php?pid=1160

or view the sources:

- include/emdros_environment.h
- MQL/emdros_environment.cpp


b) Iterators

The following classes now have Java-style iterators:

- CTable
- CSheaf
- CStraw
- CMatched_object
- CSet_of_monad_ms

These iterators are written in C++, but are accessible from the SWIG'ified
Java interface, as well as the other SWIG'ified interfaces.


c) New methods:

- EMdFDB::GetEnumConstNameFromValue() finds the first enum constant
  name with a given value in a given enumeration.  Use this to
  translate between the enum value returned by the "GET FEATURES" MQL
  statement and the textual form of the constant.  

- CEmdrosEnv::GetEnumConstFromValue is a proxy-function calling the
  EMdFDB method of the same name.


program improvements
--------------------

a) [-V | --version] on all programs

All programs (mql, manage_indices, etc.) now support a -V switch which
shows the current Emdros version along with the name of the backend.

b) [-n | --nop] on mql

The mql program has a new -n switch which causes it not to produce any
output.  This is useful for benchmarking the search-part of the MQL
engine, since outputting megabytes of results takes a long time
compared to the time it takes to produce the results.

c) New mqldump program

There is a new program, mqldump(1) for dumping an Emdros database in
MQL.  This generates an MQL script which can later be imported via the
mql(1) program.  See the manual page (or doc/mqldump.html) for more
information.


4) SWIG changes
===============

Renaming of modules
-------------------

The following SWIG modules have been renamed:

- Perl module is now called EmdrosPerl
- Python module is now called EmdrosPy
- Ruby module is now called EmdrosRb


Java test program
-----------------

There is a full-featured test program for Java in the SWIG/java
directory.  It shows not only how to use most of the Emdros API, it
also shows good Emdros application design (even if it does not show
good Java design).


Python support on Windows
-------------------------

Python support has been added for Win32.  The binaries include the
relevant files.



5) Changes to the build procedure
=================================

All platforms
-------------

The dependency on bison, flex, sed, awk, and grep has been removed by
including the relevant derived sources in the distribution.


Win32
-----

Because there is no longer a dependency on the tools mentioned above,
the gnuwin32 package, which was available from the Emdros download
page, is also no longer needed.  

SWIG support for ActiveState Python has been added to Win32.  In order
to use it, download the win32-emdros-buildtools package and follow the
instructions in win32/README.txt


Solaris
-------

Better support for the Sun Forte C++ compiler has been added in
configure.in.  In particular, there were problems with libtool and the
way it forced the compiler to handle templates.

Also, nawk is now supported in configure.in as well as gawk.


Linux
-----

- The RPM .spec files are no longer created just by running make.
  Instead, you have to run "make spec".

- A new target has been created in the top-level Makefile.am: spec2.
  It creates, from emdros.spec2.in, two spec files which create RPMs
  with the SWIG machinery.  At the same time, emdros.spec.in now
  reverts to not creating SWIG RPMs.


6) Questions? Problems? Success-stories?
========================================

Got any questions?  Is Emdros not working?  Or is Emdros working for
you?  Please let us know:

ulrikp ta users.sourceforge.net

Or visit the forums:

News in brief:

1) Introduction

2) Bugfixes

3) If something isn't working

4) Emdros mailinglist



News in full:

1) Introduction
===============

This is a bugfix release.  It fixes one trivial but major bug, as well
as a number of other bugs.


2) Bugfixes
===========

The following bugs were fixed:

a) libpcre_emdros.a was not installed on Linux/SunOS.  This caused
   inability to link against libmql.

b) A minor bug was fixed which caused GET FEATURES to fail if an enum
   had been created as the first thing when the database was first
   initialized, and then that enum was used with GET FEATURES.

c) Some topographic queries would fail with database errors
   complaining about malformed SQL.

d) A problem was fixed which caused MQL to return incorrect results
   when object blocks happened to return the same features, but in
   different orders.


3) If something isn't working
=============================

If something isn't working, please let me know.  I can be reached

- *** Version 1.1.10 *** Released Tuesday, February 25, 2003

News in brief:

1) Introduction

2) Security enhancements

3) Speed improvements

4) Win32 packages more complete

5) RPMs have no debug information

6) Deleting your CEMdFOutput object

7) libpq++ not needed

8) Bugfixes

9) SWIG interfaces for Ruby, Python, and Java

10) Run manage_indices again

11) Mailing list

12) Comments?  Suggestions?  Patches?



1) Introduction
===============

This release has three foci:

- Security enhancements
- Feature enhancements
- Bugfixes

You can read more about each below, as well as news that is important
if you have used Emdros before.


2) Security enhancements
========================

This release sees a number of security enhancements:

- All programs now let you choose a database user to connect as with
  the -u option.  This means you have as much control over access to
  your Emdros databases as your backend allows.  That is, you can use
  your backend's user/permissions settings to control access to your
  Emdros databases.  The default user is still 'emdf'.

- The default password mechanism has been removed, and you cannot turn
  it back on again.  Use -p on the Emdros programs (such as mql) to 
  give the password.

- If you do enable the default password, it will be obfuscated in the
  binary, not stored as cleartext.

- The PostgreSQL connection-abstraction now encrypts the password it
  holds, so it is not stored as cleartext.

- The MySQL connection-abstraction now doesn't store the password at
  all.

- Plus a few other security enhancements.  See the ChangeLog for
  details.


3) Speed improvements
=====================

A lot of changes were made which mostly resulted in speed
improvements.  A number of benchmark queries were run against our
testbed database with 440,000 monads and 1.4 million syntactic
objects.  These tests were run both on MySQL and on PostgreSQL, and
with 1.1.10pre1 and 1.1.10 for Emdros.  Here are the results:



              pre1    1.1.10            pre1    1.1.10     
Query         my      my      %decr     pg      pg      %decr
------------  ------  ------  -----     ------  ------  -----
q8.txt:       44.92   25.11   44.1      48.87   32.91   32.7
revabs.mql:   75.86   47.44   37.5      120.04  106.89  11.0
ri5.mql:      69.85   30.83   55.9      65.65   46.04   29.9
ps67.mql:     54.46   15.48   71.6      43.36   22.57   47.9
quest3-2.mql: 10.39   5.75    44.7      10.00   11.95   -19.5
quest3-3.mql: 10.28   5.26    48.8      9.30    12.59   -35.4
q26.txt:      67.35   28.42   57.8      66.32   45.28   31.7
hapf.mql:     36.03   13.75   61.8      25.66   18.28   28.8
nimtza.mql:   95.10   46.86   50.7      91.09   61.56   32.4
nimtza2.mql:  101.05  53.05   47.5      102.46  71.86   29.9
------------                  ----                      ----
Average                       52.0                      18.9
                              ====                      ====

These are times in seconds.

As can be seen, MySQL had consistent speed-improvements of on average
52%, whereas PostgreSQL generally had speed improvements in the region
of 30%, with a few queries taking longer than before (though not
significantly longer; note the small difference in execution times for
the two queries that took longer).


4) Win32 packages more complete
===============================

As of this release, the win32 "binary" packages include libraries and
header files as well as binary executables.

Also, the libpcre.lib library on win32 has been renamed to
"libpcre_emdros.lib".  See the ChangeLog for a rationale.


5) RPMs have no debug information
=================================

As from this release onwards, the RPMs on Linux will have no debug
information.  When constructing your own application, you will most
often not want to debug Emdros itself (although any bugreports and
especially bugfixes would be appreciated ;-) ).  But most users will
not want the extra bytes.  If you feel like debugging Emdros, you can
compile it from source, configuring it with --enable-debug, or simply
remove --disable-debug from the emdros.spec.in file and make your own
RPMs.


6) Deleting your CEMdFOutput object
===================================

The CMQL_execution_environment destructor used to delete the
CEMdFOutput object that was handed to the constructor.  It no longer
does that, meaning that you must delete the CEMdFOutput object
yourself.

The reasons for this change include:

1) It is more consistent.  The EMdFDB object is not deleted, so the
   CEMdFOutput object (which is also handed to the constructor, along
   with the EMdFDB object) should not be deleted either.

2) It may give rise to problems with garbage collection from
   SWIG'ified interfaces.

The src/mql.cpp program shows an example of How To Do It(TM), and the
programmer's reference guide has been updated.


7) libpq++ not needed
=====================

Emdros no longer needs libpq++ when using PostgreSQL.  You can leave
it out of your Makefiles and/or configure scripts.  

This allows easy compilation against PostgreSQL 7.3.x and later, which
don't include libpq++ by default.


8) Bugfixes
===========

This release also fixes a number of bugs.  Two salient bugs which have
been fixed are:

- Topographic queries used to not be able to compare 8-bit strings.
  This has been fixed.

- Comparisons in topographic queries used to work on
  string-representations of everything, rather than the underlying
  datatype.  This meant, for example, that 200 < 30, which was clearly
  not the intention.  This has been fixed.


9) SWIG interfaces for Ruby, Python, and Java
=============================================

This release sees the addition of SWIG support for Python and Java,
and cleanups of the Ruby SWIG interface.  They are also included as
RPM binaries for Linux.  This ONLY works on Linux/Sun, not Windows!

Support for Perl bindings is preliminary and experimental, and may not
work!  You have been warned.


10) Run manage_indices again
============================

This release changes a few indices.  Therefore, it is a good idea to
issue the following sequence of commands for all your databases:

manage_indices --drop -p <default password> <database name>
manage_indices --create -p <default password> <database name>


11) Emdros mailinglist
======================

There is an Emdros mailinglist where I announce new releases and other
bits of information important to Emdros users.  You can
subscribe/unsubscribe online at:

<http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=37219>

This page also has an archive of past messages.

You don't need to have a SourceForge username to be on the list.  Just
use your regular e-mail address.


12) Comments?  Suggestions?  Patches?
=====================================

As always, I would be glad to hear from you.  If you use Emdros, or
have any specific questions or requests, please drop me a line.  The
e-mail address is:

ulrikp[at]users.sourceforge.net

If you fix a bug in Emdros, or develop new functionality, please share
your bugfixes/enhancements with the Open Source community by sending
me the patches.


Enjoy!

- *** Version 1.1.10pre1 ***  Released December 19, 2002

This is an interim bugfix release.  It fixes a bug whereby Emdros
would link against PostgreSQL libraries even when doing a MySQL
compile on Linux/Solaris.

Win32 users are encouraged to download version 1.1.9 if they need
binaries.  The changes in this version are Unix-specific, except for
one minor, unimportant change (see the ChangeLog).  As a result, only
Linux binaries are provided.

- *** Version 1.1.9 ***

News in brief:

1) Introduction

2) License change

3) Bugfixes

4) Examples


Introduction
============

This release is a bugfix release.  In addition, we have taken the
opportunity to change the license from the BSD License to the GNU GPL.
See below for more information.


License change
==============

From this release onwards, Emdros is being released under the GNU GPL
rather than the BSD License.  If the change brings any problems for
you, please write to me at ulrikp[at]users.sourceforge.net and we may
be able to negotiate other licensing terms.

If you wish to negotiate commercial licensing, please write to me at
the address given above.

Licensing can also be negotiated if your organization is an
educational, non-profit, charity, missionary or similar organization.


Bugfixes
========

This release fixes a number of bugs.  The full details are in the
ChangeLog, but here are some highlights:

- If parts of a query had nothing to return because there were no
  objects in the database that matched its criteria, the mql program
  would exit with a BadMonadsException.  Now Emdros does what it is
  supposed to in such circumstances -- i.e., return empty results for
  that part of the query -- instead of exiting with an exception.

- A number of potential buffer overflows have been fixed.  It is
  unknown whether they posed any security risk, but better safe than
  sorry.


Examples
========

There is a new examples/ directory, giving a number of examples of how
to use Emdros.  There isn't much there yet, and no code to compile.
Just some queries and database schemas to study.


- *** Version 1.1.8 ***

News in brief:

1) Introduction

2) Speed improvements

3) Shared libraries on Unix

4) RPMs

5) Concurrent Emdros

6) VACUUM statement

7) Emdros (not) on Cygwin

8) Bugfixes

9) Minor improvements

10) Emdros announcement list

11) Feedback appreciated


News in full:


1) Introduction
===============

This release has both feature-enhancements and bugfixes.  The
feature-enhancements are more important than the bugfixes, so they
will be treated at more length here.

NOTE that you have to run the upgrade_db tool on any existing Emdros
databases.  Please see the section "Concurrent Emdros" below.


2) Speed improvements
=====================

One of the algorithms for querying has been improved, resulting in
fewer SQL queries sent to the backend, resulting in higher performance
on most classes of queries.

The performance increase is most noticeable where you have queries
such as the following:

[Phrase
    function = Predicate
    [Word
       psp = Verb and number = singular
    ]
]

where the outer block, Phrase, incurs a sparse set of hits (not all
phrases are predicates), which is then used as the basis for finding
the inner Words.  The old algorithm for this issued far too many SQL
queries.  The new algorithm issues very few SQL queries, which on the
other hand may have to look through more data.

One query, which took 2 hours 29 minutes to run without the speed
improvement, now takes 1 minutes 30 seconds to run.  See the ChangeLog
for the hardware specs behind this.



3) Shared libraries on Unix
===========================

This release sees the advent of shared libraries on Unix.  They are
installed in ${prefix}/lib/emdros, where ${prefix} is what you gave to
./configure with the --prefix=DIR option.  By default, this is
/usr/local, so the libraries are installed in /usr/local/lib/emdros by
default.

In order to use them in your own programs, do the following:

- Either:

  - Set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to include
    ${prefix}/lib/emdros, or

  - Add ${prefix}/lib/emdros to /etc/ld.so.conf and run
    /sbin/ldconfig.

- Link your programs against the libraries.  You will need the
  following libaries:

  - libemdf.so
  - libmql.so
  - Either:
    - For PostgreSQL support:
      - libpgemdf.so 
      - libpq.a           (included with PostgreSQL)
      - libpq++.a         (included with PostgreSQL)
    - For MySQL support:
      - libmysqlemdf.so 
      - libmysqlclient.a  (included with MySQL)

Note that you do NOT need to link against the libpcre.a any more.  It
is now included in the libmql.* libraries.


4) RPMs
=======

This release sees the possibility of building RPMs on Linux, and
possibly on other operating systems (e.g., FreeBSD).  The two files
emdros-postgresql-${version}.spec and emdros-mysql-${version}.spec are
built when running make in the top-level source directory (${version}
is replaced with the actual version, such as 1.1.8).

These .spec files will create two packages, emdros-postgresql and
emdros-mysql.  You cannot have both installed on a single machine at
the same time.  This is because the programs must be linked against
either the MySQL libraries or the PostgreSQL libraries, and they
cannot be linked against both at the same time.

Both packages include the libraries and header files necessary for
development.

The binary RPMs released are for RedHat 8.0.  If you use another
system, maybe you should try the source RPM instead:

% rpmbuild --rebuild emdros-${emdros-version}-${package-release}.src.rpm
% rpm -ivh /path/to/rpms/emdros-${back-end}-${emdros-version}-${package-release}.i386.rpm

"/path/to/rpms" is "/usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386" on RedHat.


5) Concurrent Emdros
====================

This release makes Emdros concurrent.  Up to and including 1.1.7,
there were issues with concurrently issuing CREATE OBJECT statements,
though all other aspects of Emdros were able to run concurrently.
This release fixes this bug, but it does mean that you have to run the
upgrade_db tool on already-existing databases.  The changes made to
the database are really small, and no data are lost.


6) VACUUM statement
===================

There is a new MQL statement:

VACUUM [DATABASE] [ANALYZE]
GO

This will issue an SQL VACUUM query on PostgreSQL and will be ignored
on MySQL.

The DATABASE and ANALYZE keywords are both optional.  The DATABASE
keyword doesn't do anything.  The ANALYZE keyword specifies that
PostgreSQL must ANALYZE as well as VACUUM.  See the PostgreSQL
documentation for what this does.

The significance of this statement is that while populating a
database, it is a good idea to run a VACUUM statement periodically,
since this increases performance.  This could be done, e.g., after
every 1000 objects that have been added.


7) Emdros (not) on Cygwin
=========================

As of 1.1.8, Emdros no longer supports compilation on Cygwin.  Use
Visual C++ for compilation on Win32.


8) Bugfixes
===========

This release also sees some bugfixes.

The most glaring one was that before 1.1.8, XML output had a serious
problem with text which contained either "<" or "&".  These were
supposed to have been replaced by "&lt;" and "&amp;" respectively, but
they were replaced by "&amp;" and "&lt;" respectively, thus
effectively switching the two around in the output.  The replacement
is now done correctly.

Before this release, Emdros was not really meant to be installed on a
machine.  The author used it by linking his programs against the
libraries as they were built in the sourcetree, and used the include/
directory of the sourcetree.

With this release, Emdros is fully able to be installed and used from
the install location.  This is also true for the headers to be
included in C++ development.

The following headers are now installed in addition to the ones that
were installed before:

- mql_error.h
- mql_execute.h
- mql_types.h
- mql_extern.h
- emdros-config.h
- emdros-lconfig.h

The following headers are not installed as from this release onwards:

- pcre.h
- utils.h
- emdf_wstring.h

If you have installed Emdros before, be sure to clean out the
${prefix}/include/emdros directory by removing all files, before
installing Emdros again.

Note that emdros-config.h and emdros-lconfig.h were called config.h
and lconfig.h respectively before.


9) Minor improvements
=====================

- Emdros now supports all iso-8859-X encodings.  Just pass the right
constant, defined in <emdf_output.h>, to the CEMdFOutput constructor.


10) Emdros announcement list
============================

There is an announcement mailing list on which I announce major events
related to Emdros.  The mailing list is very low-volume.  

To subscribe, send an empty e-mail to:
emdros-announce-request@lists.sourceforge.net with the subject
'subscribe' (without the quotes).  Or alternatively, visit
<URL:https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/emdros-announce>.

Note that you can only subscribe to this list with a SourceForge.Net
e-mail address.  If you aren't yet a user at sourceforge.net, you can
quickly become one by visiting <URL:http://sourceforge.net>.  It's
free.


11) Feedback appreciated
========================

I would appreciate feedback from users.

If you are using Emdros for anything, please drop me a line saying so.
On the other hand, if you would have liked to use Emdros, but can't or
won't because something is missing or broken, I would also welcome
hearing about it.

If you have any requests or questions or bugreports or other feedback,
please don't hesitate to send me an e-mail:

- *** Version 1.1.7 ***

News in brief:

1) Bugfixes

2) Speed improvements

3) Enumerations are now namespaces

4) Additions to "HOW-TO-USE" document


1) Bugfixes
===========

Introduction
------------

This release has bugfixes in three major areas: Feature comparisons,
the power construct, and memory leaks.  Below, we look at each of
these.


Feature comparisons
-------------------

This release fixes a bug which caused many queries of the "SELECT
(ALL|FOCUS) OBJECTS"-kind not to return any results.  This bug
manifested itself when feature comparisons did not mention the
features in alphabetical order.  For example, the following query did
return results:

select all objects where
[word
   gender = masculine
   and
   psp = proper_noun
]
go

whereas the following didn't:

select all objects where
[word
   psp = proper_noun
   and
   gender = masculine
]
go

Thanks to Hendrik Jan Bosman (hjb at th dot vu dot nl) for finding and
reporting this bug.


Power construct
---------------

Also, two bugs relating to the power construct in "SELECT (ALL|FOCUS)
OBJECTS" queries have been fixed.  Take, for example, the following
query:

SELECT ALL OBJECTS
WHERE
[Sentence
  [Clause as c]
  ..
  [Clause mother = c.self]
]

This query is supposed to find, within the context of a sentence, two
clauses where the second has the first as its mother, with arbitrary
space in between.

A bug was fixed that caused the .. to include at least 1 monad of
space in between the first and the second clause.  Now the space can
be 0 monads as well, meaning that it will find adjacent objects as
well as those separated by 1 or more monads.

The second bug related to restrictors or limits on the number of
monads in between.  Take, for example, the above query with an added
restrictor:

SELECT ALL OBJECTS
WHERE
[Sentence
  [Clause as c]
  .. <= 5
  [Clause mother = c.self]
]

This simply did not work.  It would find clauses that were separated
by _more_ than 5 monads, not less than or equal to five monads.  This
bug has been fixed so that things now work as designed.



Memory leaks
------------

This release sees the fixing of some minor memory leaks. See the
ChangeLog for details.  For this bugfixing, valgrind was
used. Valgrind is a superb tool for detecting memory-problems on
x86-Linux platforms.  See <http://developer.kde.org/~sewardj/> for
more information.



2) Speed improvements
=====================

This release sees major speed improvements for certain classes of
queries.  If a query involves nested objects with a high degree of
monad-fragmentation (i.e., the inner object(s) are to be found in many
different monad-segments, because, e.g., the outer objects have some
sort of restriction on their features), then this release speeds up
those queries.  For example, take the following query:

select all objects 
where
[clause_atom
   clause_atom_type = ct_WayX
   [phrase focus
      function = Subj
   ]
]
go

On previous releases, this query would take 96.45 minutes to complete
on a 700MHz Pentium III.  This was due to an inefficient strategy,
where the backend database was queried thousands of times. With this
release, those thousands of queries have been gathered together in a
few large queries.  As a result, this query now takes 3.70 minutes to
complete on the same hardware.

This illustrates a principle that is general to application design on
top of Emdros as well as being appliccable to internal Emdros design:
Minimize the number of queries to maximize throughput.  A section
expounding this principle has been added to the doc/HOW-TO-USE
document (see below).



3) Enumerations are now namespaces
==================================

With this release, it becomes possible to have enumeration constants
with the same name in different enumerations.  Before this release,
enumerations had to be globally unique.  With this release, the only
restriction on uniqueness is that the constants be unique _within_ an
enumeration.

A section has been added to the MQL User's Guide, at the beginning of
Chapter 3, detailing the various namespaces that exist in the MQL
language.



4) Additions to "HOW-TO-USE" document
=====================================

This release adds three useful sections to the doc/HOW-TO-USE
document:

- Minimize the number of queries (to maximize throughput)
- A strategy for display of query results
- An in-memory EMdF database



- *** Version 1.1.6 ***

News in brief:

1) New statement
2) MQL User's Guide changes (XML output has been implemented)
3) Monad sets document


News in full:


1) New statement
================

This release sees the addition of a new statement, "SELECT OBJECTS
HAVING MONADS IN" some monad set.  This statement is much like the
existing SELECT OBJECTS AT statement, but instead of selecting the
objects that have a given monad, it selects the objects that have at
least one monad in a specified monad set.  This can be done for just
one specified object type, or it can be done for "ALL" object types.
The latter is useful for finding out exactly what objects are at a
given monad, even if one does not know their object type.

This is major news, especially if you are currently using Emdros for
an application that displays the results of queries.  In that case,
you are most likely relying on the SELECT OBJECTS AT statement to
return the id_ds of objects that are necessary for the display of the
query results, but which weren't in the query results.  This can be
slow, especially if the query result contains many monads, since one
must invoke the MQL query engine a lot of times, each time generating
at least one SQL statement.

With this new statement, you can get all of the necessary objects for
a particular object type with one query.  This should be significantly
faster.


2) MQL User's Guide changes (XML output has been implemented)
=============================================================

Up until this release, the MQL User's Guide erroneously stated that
XML output had not yet been implemented.  XML output was implemented
quite some time ago.  We apologize for any inconvenience caused by the
erroneous statement.

Also, chapters 1 and 2 have been proof-read and accordingly updated.


3) Monad sets document
======================

This release also sees the advent of a new document, entitled "Monad
Sets -- Implementation and Mathematical Foundations".  It gives an
introduction to an efficient way of implementing monad sets.  Use this
if you wish to implement monad sets in a language other than C++, or
if you want to find out what underlies the C++ implementation in
Emdros.




- *** Version 1.1.5 ***

News in brief:

1) This is a bugfix release

2) You must upgrade your databases




News in full:


1) This is a bugfix release
===========================

The focus of this release is bugfixes, although there are a few minor
feature-enhancements.  

Bugfixes:

- A major memory leak was fixed, which caused the mql subsystem to
  crash on particularly large queries.

- SELECT (FOCUS|ALL) OBJECTS now actually obeys restriction of Su
  with the USING SEGMENT clause.

- SELECT (FOCUS|ALL) OBJECTS now actually works within the
  confines of all_m-1, as advertised in the User's Guide.

- A minor bug in weeding object blocks for first/last usage was
  squashed.


Enhancements:

- Emdros databases now keep track of the smallest monad and the
  largest monad in use in the database.  These monads are called min_m
  and max_m respectively.  This is useful when querying databases with
  certain types of queries, since this will now occur within the
  confines of the actual monads in the databases (also called
  all_m-1), and won't just go on indefinitely into the monad sequence.

- Two new MQL statements return min_m and max_m (SELECT MIN_M and
  SELECT MAX_M respectively).

- One minor enhancement relating to the feature "self".  See the
  ChangeLog for details.

- The tests/emdftry program now stops after the first error.  It also
  tests retrieval of min_m and max_m, as does tests/mqltry.


2) You must upgrade your databases
==================================

Because of the new min_m/max_m capabilities, you must upgrade your
Emdros databases to include the new tables for min_m/max_m.  You can
safely and without loss of information do this using the upgrade_db(1)
tool found in the src/ directory.  See the manual page (in doc/) for
details.

The upgrade_db tool also upgrades databases created with Emdros prior
to version 1.1.0.  Such an upgrade is more drastic and takes more
time, and something could go wrong if, e.g., your computer has a power
outage in the middle of the operation.

It is, of course, recommended that you backup your databases before
running the upgrade_db tool, but the transition from 1.1.0-compatible
databases to 1.1.5-compatible is really minor.  Again, see the manual
page for details.





- *** Version 1.1.4 ***

1) MQL User's Guide almost finished

2) Feature-enhancements

3) Comments in MQL queries

3) Bugs fixed

4) Binaries for Windows


1) MQL User's Guide almost finished
===================================

This release adds an MQL User's Guide that is almost finished!  It
still has the comment in the abstract about it not being finished, but
it really is almost done.


2) Feature enhancements
=======================

This release has the following feature-enhancements:

- MQL can now have comments (see below).
- New MQL statement: MONAD SET CALCULATION.  See the MQL User's Guide
  for details.
- All programs now accept --host and --password command-line switches.
- Added man pages for emdftry(1) and mqltry(1).
- Now builds with Visual C++ under Win32.  See INSTALL.Win32.


3) Comments in MQL queries
==========================

This release adds support for comments in MQL queries.  In particular,
both C-style and C++-style comments are supported.  C-style comments
look like this:

/* This is a C-style comment.  It starts with a slash-star.
   It may extend over several lines, and ends with star-slash. */

C++ style comments look like this:

// This is a C++ style comment. It starts with slash-slash.

// This is another C++ style comment.  It ends at newline.


4) Bugs fixed
=============

Bugs fixed:

- "first" and "last" specifiers on object blocks now actually work.



5) Binaries for Windows
=======================

This release also provides binaries for Windows.  Please see
INSTALL.Win32 for details.

The binaries have been tested with the following versions of the
backends:

- PostgreSQL 7.2.1
- MySQL 3.23.49

Other versions may or may not work.

Unlike the binaries released with Emdros version 1.1.3, these binaries
do not require CygWin to be present.


Please note that provision of binaries is an experiment.  We may or
may not provide binaries in the future.



- *** Version 1.1.3 ***

News in brief:

1) This is a bugfix release

2) Binaries for Windows

3) Enabling or disabling debugging information


1) This is a bugfix release
===========================

This release fixes a nuber of small bugs, one of which caused the
mql(1) program not to work with stdin when compiled with some versions
of gcc.  See the ChangeLog for details.


2) Binaries for Windows
=======================

This release also provides binaries for Windows.  Please see
INSTALL.Win32 for details.

The compiled binaries use the following software, available for free
from: http://www.cygwin.com/:

- PostgreSQL 7.2.1
- CygWin 1.3.10

other versions may or may not work.

You need to download this in order to use Emdros on Windows, as well
as possibly a number of other packages from the CygWin distribution.

Please note that provision of binaries is an experiment.  We may or
may not provide binaries in the future.


3) Enabling or disabling debugging information
==============================================

This release enables you to turn debugging on or off by using the
--enable-debug or --disable-debug switch with the ./configure script.
This release also honors any CXXFLAGS or CFLAGS environment variable
you may have set.



- *** Version 1.1.2 ***

News in brief:

1) This is a bugfix release

2) Binaries for Windows

3) How to use Emdros

4) Feedback appreciated


1) This is a bugfix release
===========================

This is a bugfix release which makes it easier to compile on various
platforms, including Cygwin on Windows.  Support for bison version
1.35 has been added.  Also, PCRE has been upgraded to version 3.9.
There are one or two feature-enhancements.  See the ChangeLog for full
details.


2) Binaries for Windows
=======================

This release is also released as binaries for Windows.  The binaries
make use the following software:

- Cygwin 1.3.10
- PostgreSQL 7.2.1

Both are freely available from www.cygwin.com.

Other versions may or may not work.

Be sure to follow the instructions in doc/bootstrapping.txt, as well
as some of the instructions in INSTALL and INSTALL.Win32.  Even though
you don't need to compile Emdros yourself with this binary release,
you will need to follow some of the instructions in those files.

This release is an experiment.  We may or may not release
Windows-binaries for future versions of Emdros.


3) How to use Emdros
====================

There's a new file in the doc/ directory, HOW-TO-USE for your reading
pleasure.


4) Feedback appreciated
=======================

Something doesn't work?  You'd like to see some new feature?  You'd
like to know how to use Emdros?  Send the author an e-mail at
ulrikp@users.sourceforge.net, or ask questions in the fora at:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/emdros



- *** Version 1.1.1 ***

News in brief:

1) New MQL statement: GET MONADS

2) New command-line switches for mql(1)

3) If upgrading from a prior version

4) Tips for importing data on PostgreSQL

5) Join the emdros-announce list



1) New MQL statement: GET MONADS
================================

This release adds a new MQL statement to the MQL language.  For
example:

GET MONADS
FROM OBJECTS
WITH ID_DS = 82854, 82950, 85021
[Clause]

This will return a table with the monad-sets making up the objects of
the object-type "Clause" which have the id_ds specified.  See the MQL
User's Guide for details.



2) New command-line switches for mql(1)
=======================================

The mql(1) program now has three new command-line options:

 --help                (which shows a help summary on stdout)
 -d , --dbname dbname  (which sets the initial database)
 -h , --host hostname  (which specifies which db back-end host to
                        connect to)

See the man page for details, or do

  $ mql --help


3) If upgrading from a prior version
====================================

If upgrading from a version prior to 1.1.0, please see the NEWS for
1.1.0, below.


4) Tips for importing data
==========================

We have imported a large corpus of syntactically analyze text into a
local Emdros database.  The database consists of about 425000 words
(and so about 425000 monads), and about 1.4 million syntactic objects
(phrases, clauses, etc.).  

We have naturally gathered some experience importing large amounts of
data.  Here are the most important insights.  Most of them pertain to
PostgreSQL only, but the first ones apply equally to MySQL.

1) Create an MQL "schema" file, which contains all the CREATE ENUM and
   CREATE OBJECT TYPE statements needed to bootstrap the database.
   Then run this schema file through the mql(1) program.

2) Use MQL's features for importing, such as CREATE OBJECT.  This is
   far easier than using the EMdFDB interface.

3) On PostgreSQL, it is a good idea to import within transactions.
   This is also mentioned in the PostgreSQL manual: It allows
   PostgreSQL not to commit after every INSERT.  Use
   EMdFDB::BeginTransaction and its brethren to accomplish this.

4) On PostgreSQL, it is a _very_ good idea to do a VACUUM on the
   database periodically, say after every 2000 objects.  There is now
   a function, EMdFDB::Vacuum(bool bAnalyze) which accomplishes this.
   We found that this speeded import-times by about a factor 10 if it
   was done regularly.



5) Join the emdros-announce list
================================

An announce-mailinglist for Emdros exists.  By joining this list, you
will be among the first to hear about new Emdros releases and new
documentation-releases, and possibly other pertinent news.  This
mailinglist won't be high-volume, and it is easy to get off the list
again.

To subscribe, send an empty e-mail to:
emdros-announce-request@lists.sourceforge.net with the subject
'subscribe' (without the quotes).  Or alternatively, visit
<URL:https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/emdros-announce>.

Note that you can only subscribe to this list with a SourceForge.Net
e-mail address.  If you aren't yet a user at sourceforge.net, you can
quickly become one by visiting <URL:http://sourceforge.net>.




- *** Version 1.1.0 ***

News in brief:

1) You must *upgrade* databases created with a previous version of
   Emdros for use with this release.

2) New tool for managing indices

3) Emdros now supports XML output.

4) PgEMdFDB has a new constructor-interface.

5) mql(1) can now be used as a daemon.

6) EMdFDB has a changed interface.

7) PostgreSQL users should give the user 'emdf' a password.

8) New tool for changing the default password.

9) Join the Emdros-announce list.

10) Feedback would be appreciated!



1) Upgrading old databases
==========================

NOTE: YOU MUST UPGRADE ANY DATABASES CREATED WITH A PREVIOUS VERSION
      OF EMDROS IN ORDER TO USE THEM WITH THIS RELEASE.

This release brings some news which affect database structure.
Specifically:

- The objects table is now no longer needed.

- The OT_monad_ds tables are no longer needed.

- The OT_monad_ms tables have gotten a new attribute, namely
  'is_first', taking over the job of the attribute 'starts_here' in
  the old OT_monad_ds tables.

- Indices are created on OT_objects and OT_monad_ms.

- The sequences table has been split into two tables, sequence_0 and
  sequence_1, which hold the object id_ds and other ids respectively.
  This is a HUGE performance-increase for inserting objects on
  PostgreSQL, on the order of 1300%!

- When creating new databases, the OT_monad_ms table now no longer has
  a PRIMARY KEY of (monad_ms_id, mse_first, mse_last), but only
  (monad_ms_id).  This should give a slight performance increase on
  new databases.

This means that you must *upgrade* any databases you have created with
previous versions of Emdros, or alternatively start from scratch.  A
utility to upgrade safely is provided ('upgrade_db') in the src/
directory.  Usage:

$ src/upgrade_db database-name

where database-name is the name of the database you want to upgrade.

It is suggested that you make a BACKUP of your data before attempting
the upgrade.  See the PostgreSQL/MySQL documentation for how to do
this.

If running PostgreSQL, it is suggested that you "VACUUM" the database
after the upgrade.  See the PostgreSQL documentation for how to do
this.


2) New tool for managing indices
================================

There is a new tool, manage_indices, in src/, for creating and
dropping indices on the object types of an Emdros database.  Please
see the manage_indices(1) man-page for details.  The upgrade_db tool
puts the indices on the tables belonging to all of the object types.

The manage_indices utility can be used for dropping indices before a
long database-population job, and then to recreate the indices after
the database has been populated.


3) Emdros now supports XML output
=================================

The subsystem that has to do with output has been revamped so that it
now supports XML-output.  

The XML output is self-documenting, with a standalone DTD.

The mql(1) front-end to the MQL language now has a new interface which
allows selection of XML or console-output.  Please see the mql(1)
man-page for details.

The MQL/mql_execution_environment.cpp constructor has a new interface.
It no longer takes a stream as an argument, but a pointer to a
CEMdFOutput object.  This means you should bring any program using
this interface up to date.


4) PgEMdFDB has a new constructor-interface
===========================================

This release brings a change in how the PgEMdFDB object is
constructed.  Please see EMdF/pgemdfdb.h for the signature, and
src/mql.cpp for an example of how to use it.

This means that you will have to change your sources that use the
PgEMdFDB::PgEMdFDB constructor.  The upgrade is easy -- no big deal --
it just needs to be done.


5) mql(1) can now be used as a daemon
=====================================

There is now rudmentary support for using the mql(1) program as a
daemon in conjunction with xinetd or inetd.  The doc/ directory
contains a samle xinetd.conf snippet, xinetd.mql.  Note that you will
need to edit this file, before using it, to suit your local system.

There is now a new MQL statement, QUIT.  Any statements after this
statement will be ignored.  The mql(1) program stops executing its
input stream after it has executed this command.  Thus this can be
used as a means of shutting down the connection to the MQL daemon.

Also, when the output-type is XML, there will be an
<mql_progress>...</mql_progress> element whose contents are dots.  The
dots show the progress of executing a statement that takes long.
However, this is only shown for SELECT OBJECTS statements, and there
is no guarantee of when the next dot will arrive.  Thus this cannot be
used as a timeout measurement means.  See the emitted standalone DTD
for where in the XML stream the <mql_progress> element is emitted.


6) EMdFDB has a changed interface
=================================

EMdFDB now uses const std::string& instead of const char* for all of
its interface functions.  This is important if you have written
something that uses the raw EMdFDB interface.


7) PostgreSQL users should give user 'emdf' a password
======================================================

PotsgreSQL users are advised that the programs now by default assume
that the PostgreSQL user 'emdf' has password 'changeme'.

You can give an already-existing emdf user a password by issuing this
command from within psql:

# ALTER USER emdf WITH PASSWORD 'changeme';

I suggest you choose something other than 'changeme' and likewise
change the passwords in the program files:

src/mql.cpp
src/upgrade_db.cpp
src/manage_indices.cpp
tests/emdftry.cpp
tests/mqltry.cpp


8) New tool for changing the default password
=============================================

There is now a small shellscript in the root directory of the
distribution for automatically changing the default password to
something of your choice.  See the shellscript './change_password.sh'
for how to use this.


9) Join the emdros-announce list
================================

A new announce-mailinglist for Emdros has been set up.  By joining
this list, you will be among the first to hear about new Emdros
releases and new documentation-releases, and possibly other pertinent
news.  This mailinglist won't be high-volume, and it is easy to get
off the list again.

To subscribe, send an empty e-mail to:
emdros-announce-request@lists.sourceforge.net with the subject
'subscribe' (without the quotes).  Or alternatively, visit
<URL:https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/emdros-announce>.

Note that you can only subscribe to this list with a SourceForge.Net
e-mail address.  If you aren't yet a user at sourceforge.net, you can
quickly become so by visiting <URL:http://sourceforge.net>.


10) Feedback would be appreciated!
==================================

If you are using Emdros for anything, we would like to know about it.
On the other hand, if you would have liked to use Emdros, but can't or
won't because something is missing or broken, we would also like to
know about it.

If you have any requests or questions or bugreports or other feedback,
please drop us a line at
