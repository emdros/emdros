README for Emdros SWIG-Ruby

Introduction
============

This document explains how to use the SWIG PHP bindings for Emdros.

This document is still sketchy.


How to use
==========

1) Set up php.ini to have the following line (modify the path as
appropriate):

extension=/usr/lib/emdros/EmdrosPHP.so

You can also do this by copying the file "EmdrosPHP.ini" into your
/etc/php.d/ directory.  The EmdrosPHP.ini file will have been
installed in /usr/share/doc/emdros/, or similar path.

2) In your PHP script, add the following line (again, adjust the path
as appropriate):

require('/usr/lib/emdros/EmdrosPHP.php');

3) Write your PHP code to use Emdros. There is an example in
 /usr/share/doc/emdros/test.php.


Things to be aware of
=====================

1) bool& and long& parameters
-----------------------------

With reference to the Emdros C++ API:

- Whenever a C++ method or function has a parameter which is bool& or
  a long&, that parameter gets returned from the method or function in
  a PHP array, along with any return value.  For example, the
  "EmdrosEnv::executeString()" method has a signature as follows:

  bool executeString(const std::string& input, bool& bResult, 
                      bool bPrintResult, bool bReportError);

  This means that you should call it like this:

  $bPrintResult = true; // Or false... depending on what you want
  $bReportError = true; // Or false... depending on what you want
  $arrResult = $env->executeString($query, $bPrintResult, $bReportError);
  $bDBOK = $arrResult[0];
  // Note how the bResult is passed in the return value
  $bResult = $arrResult[1];  // == bCompilerOK


2) methods called 'empty'
-------------------------

Since 'empty' is a PHP keyword, methods which are called 'empty' have
been renamed to 'c_empty'.

Please write to me if you have any further insights, or if something
doesn't work.
