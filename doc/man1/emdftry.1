.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBemdftry\fR is a tool for testing basic Emdros functionality.  In
particular, it exercises the EMdF layer.  It should run with no
errors, emitting a lot of messages.  Most of them will start with the
word SUCCESS.  If any error occurs, a FAILURE message will appear, and
the program will not run any further tests.

If all tests completed successfully, the last line of output will be
"SUCCESS: All tests completed successfully."

If at least one test failed, the last line of output will be "FAILURE:
At least one test failed."
