.SH NAME
eqtc \- Query arbitrary Emdros databases
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBeqtc\fR [ options ] 
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBeqtc\fR is a generic query tool for Emdros databases.  It shows
the results in a way that is more meaningful than the output from
mql(1).  See the homepage for more information:

http://emdros.org/qrytool/

Typical usage would be:

eqtc -c myconfigfile.cfg

If built to use MySQL or PostgreSQL, then you may need additional
options such as "-u username", "-p password" and "-h hostname".

.SH OPTIONS
\fBeqtc\fR supports the following command-line switches:
.TP 6
.BI \-\-help
show help
.TP
.BI \-V\ ,\ \-\-version
show version
.TP
.BI \-b\ ,\ \-\-backend \ backend
set database backend to `backend'. Valid values are: For PostgreSQL:
"p", "pg", "postgres", and "postgresql". For MySQL: "m", "my", and
"mysql". For SQLite 2.X.X: "2", "s", "l", "lt", "sqlite", and
"sqlite2". For SQLite 3.X.X: "3", "s3", "lt3", and "sqlite3".
.TP
.BI \-c\ configfile
set the name of the ocnfiguration file
.TP
.BI \-d\ ,\ \-\-dbname \ dbname 
set database name (overrides what is in the config file)
.TP
.BI \-h\ ,\ \-\-host \ hostname 
set db back-end hostname to connect to (default is 'localhost') (has no effect on SQLite)
.TP
.BI \-u\ ,\ \-\-user \ user
set database user to connect as (default is 'emdf') (has no effect on SQLite)
.TP
.BI \-p\ ,\ \-\-password \ password
set password to use for the database user.  Has no effect on SQLite,
unless you have an encryption-enabled SQLite, in which case this gets
passed as the key.


.SH CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT

\fBeqtc\fR must be given the name of a configuration file (with the
-c option).  This configuration file tells eqtc the basic parameters
which it needs in order to work.

The configuration file has a very standard format: a) Everything from
a hash-mark (#) to the end of the line is ignored. b) blank lines are
ignored. c) All other lines should be in the form "key = value" where
both key and value consist of non-whitespace.

A number of sample configuration files are provided (one is
"default.cfg").  They are probably located in
@prefix@/share/emdros/qrytool/ (if on Unix/Linux/Mac OS X), while on
Windows they are probably in INSTALLPREFIX\etc\.  The configuration
file is explained at the following URL:
