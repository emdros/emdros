.SH NAME
eqt \- Query arbitrary Emdros databases with a GUI
eqtu \- Query arbitrary Emdros databases with a Unicode GUI
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBeqt\fR
.br
\fBeqtu\fR
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBeqt\fR is a generic query tool for Emdros databases.  It shows the
results in a way that is more meaningful than the output from mql(1).
It exists in two versions: \fBeqt\fR for non-Unicode databases, and
\fBeqtu\fR for databases containing Unicode characters.

Note on Linux/Unix, eqtu(1) may actually replace eqt(1).  This occurs
if the default wxWidgets installation uses Unicode.  In that case, the
non-Unicode version is not available.

See the homepage for more information:

.SH OPTIONS

.SH CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT

\fBeqt(u)\fR asks for a configuration file upon startup.  This
configuration file tells \fBeqt(u)\fR the basic parameters which it
needs in order to work.

The configuration file has a very standard format: a) Everything from
a hash-mark (#) to the end of the line is ignored. b) blank lines are
ignored. c) All other lines should be in the form "key = value" where
both key and value consist of non-whitespace.

A number of sample configuration files are provided (one is
"default.cfg").  They are probably located in
@prefix@/share/emdros/qrytool/ (if on Unix/Linux/Mac OS X), while on
Windows they are probably in INSTALLPREFIX\etc\.  The configuration
file is explained at the following URL:
