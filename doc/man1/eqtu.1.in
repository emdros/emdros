.SH NAME
eqtu \- Query arbitrary Emdros databases with a GUI
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBeqtu\fR
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBeqtu\fR is a generic query tool for Emdros databases.  It shows the
results in a way that is more meaningful than the output from mql(1).

See the homepage for more information:

http://emdros.org/qrytool/


.SH OPTIONS
\fBeqtu\fR supports the following command-line switches:
.TP 6

"p", "pg", "postgres", and "postgresql". For MySQL: "m", "my", and
"mysql". For SQLite 2.X.X: "2", "s", "l", "lt", "sqlite", and
"sqlite2". For SQLite 3.X.X: "3", "s3", "lt3", and "sqlite3".
.TP

.TP
.BI \-d\ ,\ \-\-dbname \ dbname

.TP
.BI \-p\ ,\ \-\-password \ password

passed as the key.

.SH CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT

\fBeqtu\fR asks for a configuration file upon startup.  This
configuration file tells \fBeqtu\fR the basic parameters which it
needs in order to work.

The configuration file has a very standard format: a) Everything from
a hash-mark (#) to the end of the line is ignored. b) blank lines are
ignored. c) All other lines should be in the form "key = value" where
both key and value consist of non-whitespace.

A number of sample configuration files are provided (one is
"default.cfg").  They are probably located in
@prefix@/share/emdros/qrytool/ (if on Unix/Linux/Mac OS X), while on
Windows they are probably in INSTALLPREFIX\etc\.  The configuration
file is explained at the following URL:
