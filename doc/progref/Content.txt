<page ID="1020">

<P>Emdros fits into an architecture as follows:</P>

<PRE class="code">
+---------------+
{PREPIPE}  Application  {PREPIPE} Which you must write
+---------------+
       {PREPIPE}
+---------------+
{PREPIPE}   Harvest     {PREPIPE} Emdros
+---------------+

+---------------+
{PREPIPE}      DB       {PREPIPE} PostgreSQL or MySQL or SQLite3 or SQLite2 or BPT
+---------------+
</pre><!-- widthincm : 12 -->

<P>At the top, we have your application, which in turn rests on
Emdros.  Emdros is made up of three layers, first the "Harvest" layer,
then the MQL layer, which then rests upon the EMdF layer.  The EMdF
layer, in turn, interacts with the underlying RDBMS or the BPT storage
layer.</P>

<P>Four RDBMS backends are currently supported, as shown. An
alternative, proprietary backend backend ("BPT") exists.  This backend
features much faster querying speed, as well as much smaller
databases, making it ideal for deployment on mobile devices running
iOS, Android, and other mobile platforms.</P>

<P>This Programmer's Reference Guide is about making you successful in
building your application.</P>

</page>



<page ID="1030">

<P>In this section, we describe two things:</P>

<OL>

  <LI><page_anchor ID="1031">Four ways</page_anchor> to call Emdros,
  and

  <LI>The <page_anchor ID="1040">details</page_anchor> of how to do
  so.

</OL>

</page>



<page ID="1031">

<P>There are a number of ways you can go about writing your
application.  Here are four of them:</P>

<OL>

  <LI><P>Write your application in C++, interacting directly with the
  Emdros libraries.</P>

  <LI><P>Write your application in one of the scripting languages
  which Emdros supports through <A
  HREF="http://www.swig.org/">SWIG</A> (currently Python 2.7, Python
  3.x, Perl, Ruby, Java, C#/.Net, Node.JS, PHP5, and PHP7).

  <LI><P>Interface via the mql(1) program as a command-line program,
  or via a system() call or the like.</P>

  <LI><P>Write a wrapper around Emdros, and call it from, e.g., iOS,
  Android, or via a web-API using Node.JS, Django, or similar.</P>

</OL>

<P>We will look at each of these in turn.</P>

</page>



<page ID="1032">

<h2>Benefits</h2>

<P>Interfacing with Emdros via C++ offers the following benefits:</p>

<UL>

  <LI>Greatest performance:

     <UL>

        <LI><P>No need to parse the output of the MQL engine.  You can
            use the datastructures returned by MQL directly instead of
            first dumping them to stdout, then reading them back into
            memory again.  This saves both space and time.</P>

        <LI><P>No need to start and stop the mql(1) process.
            Everything is done in-process.</P>

        <LI><P>Persistence of back-end connection: No need to connect
            and reconnect to the back-end.  This saves time.</P>

     </UL>

  <LI>Greatest flexibility: You can use the full EMdF API, rather than
  "just" the MQL API.

</UL>

<h2>Drawbacks</h2>

<P>Drawbacks include:</p>

<UL>

  <LI><P>Greater complexity, due to:</P>

      <UL>

         <LI>Complexity of C++ language,

         <LI>Complexity of Emdros APIs.

      </UL>

  <LI><P>Steeper learning-curve (due to greater complexity).</P>

</UL>

</page>


<page ID="1035">

<h2>Overview</h2>

<P><A HREF="http://www.swig.org/">SWIG</A> is the "Simplified Wrapper
Generator", and allows a programmer to wrap his C or C++ application's
interface so that it can be used from a number of scripting
languages.</P>

<P>Emdros implements SWIG interfaces for a number of languages.  They
include:</P>

<UL>

  <LI>Python 2.7
  <LI>Python 3.x
  <LI>Java
  <LI>C# (or other .Net languages)
  <LI>Ruby
  <LI>Perl
  <LI>PHP5
  <LI>PHP7

</UL>

<P>This means that you can use Emdros from these scripting languages
as though you were writing in C++ with almost no performance overhead.
The libraries are linked in through dynamic library loading.</P>

<P>Granted, Java and C# are not scripting languages, but are mentioned
as such here for simplicity of presentation.</P>

<P><STRONG>Availability Note:</STRONG> currently, <strong>only Python
2.7</strong>-bindings, <strong>C#/.Net</strong>-bindings, and
<strong>Java</strong>-bindings are <strong>available on
Windows</strong>.  All are available on Linux, and some are available
on macOS/Mac OS X.  It is unknown whether any will work on Solaris.</P>


<h2>Benefits</h2>

<P>Benefits include:</p>

<UL>

  <LI>Having the simplicity and rapid prototyping of scripting
  languages.
  
  <LI>Losing none of the power of direct access to the Emdros class
  hierarchy.

  <LI>Not having to parse the output from MQL, instead directly
  accessing the <page_anchor ID="1139">MQLResult</page_anchor>
  object.  This reduces performance overhead.

</UL>

<h2>Drawbacks</h2>

<P>Drawbacks include:</p>

<UL>

  <LI>Slightly slower performance than with pure C++.

</UL>


</page>


<page ID="1033">

<h2>Overview</h2>

<P>You can use the mql(1) program for interfacing with Emdros.  In C,
this is typically done with the system() library-call.
Scripting-languages such as Ruby, Perl, and Python have their own ways
of calling external programs.</p>

<h2>Benefits</h2>

<P>Benefits include:</p>

<UL>

  <LI><P>Simplicity: The only APIs to learn are:</P>

      <UL>

          <LI><P>The MQL language itself (which you must learn anyway),</P>

          <LI><P>The format of the MQL output,</P>

          <LI><P>The exit-status codes of the mql(1) program.</P>

      </UL>

</UL>

<h2>Drawbacks</h2>

<P>Drawbacks include:</p>

<UL>

  <LI><P>Less performance:</P>

      <UL>

          <LI><P>Output must be parsed and the datastructures
              recreated.  This takes both space and time.</P>

          <LI><P>mql(1) process must be started and stopped for each
              collection of MQL statements you wish to have evaluated.
              This takes time.</P>

          <LI><P>Back-end connection is established and broken
              together with the mql(1) process.  This takes time.</P>

      </UL>

  <LI><P>Less flexibility: You can only interface with Emdros via the
      MQL language, not the EMdF API.</P>

</UL>


<P>That having been said, it may be possible to keep the mql(1)
process running, keeping an open pipe between your application and the
mql(1) process.  If so, the only performance-problem that remains is
the parsing of the output.</p>



</page>



<page ID="1034">

<h2>Overview</h2>

<P>You can write a wrapper around Emdros which only uses the part(s)
you actually need, then use that wrapper inside of an environment such
as:</P>

<UL>

	<LI><P>iOS: In this case, you can write a wrapper in
	Objective-C++ or Objective-C and interface with either Swift
	or our Objective-C/C++ application.</P>

	<LI><P>Android: In this case, you write a C++ wrapper around
	Emdros which implements a JNI interface, then use NDK to
	compile it, then interface with the Java parts of the JNI
	interface from your application.  Please contact the author of
	Emdros for further details.</P>

	<LI><P>Web API: In this case, you write your wrapper in one of
	the supported language bindings (currently Python 2.7, Python
	3.x, C#, Java, Ruby, Perl, PHP5, and PHP7), and then hook your
	wrapper up to a web-api that suits your needs, such as a
	RESTful API or a JSON or SOAP API.  You need to write both the
	wrapper and the Web API at this point, though plans are
	underway to make some general Web APIs around Emdros.</P>

</UL>


</page>




<page ID="1040">

<P>Having described the benefits and drawbacks of each method of
calling Emdros, let us describe how to actually do it.</P>

</page>



<page ID="1041">

<P>In this section, we will describe how to interface to Emdros via
the mql(1) program.</P>

</page>



<page ID="1042">

<h2>As a command</h2>

<P>When calling mql(1) as a command, you can either pass the input on
a file or on stdin.  The output is given on stdout.</P>

<P>You can capture the output by redirecting it to a file (e.g.,
append "&gt; /tmp/x13wd93pq" to the command line).  Alternatively, set up
a pipe between your application and the mql(1) program.  See your
system manual pages for how to do this.</P>

<P>See the mql(1) man-page for details of command-line options and
command-line syntax.</P>


</page>



<page ID="1043">

<h2>Three choices</h2>

<P>You have three choices for output, specified by two command-line
switches:</P>

<UL>

  <LI><P><strong><page_anchor ID="1047">XML
  output</page_anchor></strong>, which is suitable for interaction between
  programs, and</P>

  <LI><P><strong><page_anchor ID="1049">JSON
  output</page_anchor></strong>, which is suitable for interaction between
  programs and is simpler than XML, and </P>

  <LI><P><strong><page_anchor ID="1048">Console
  output</page_anchor></strong>, which is slightly more human-readable
  than XML output.</P>

</UL>

</page>



<page ID="1047">

<h2>Benefits</h2>

<P>Benefits include:</P>

<UL>

  <LI><P>Has better support for error-handling: It tells you
  explicitly when something when wrong, in what stage of the MQL
  compiler, the source of the error (compiler or back-end), and any
  error message.</P>

  <LI><P>Tells you exactly when a command is being processed and when
  it is finished.</P>

  <LI><P>Shows the progress of query-queries.</P>

</UL>

<h2>Drawbacks</h2>

<P>Drawbacks include:</P>

<UL>

  <LI><P>More verbose, and may take longer to parse.</P>

  <LI><P>More complex in its syntax and more complex to parse.</P>

</UL>

<P>Later, we will expound the <page_anchor ID="1150">DTD</page_anchor>
of the XML output.</P>



</page>

<page ID="1049">

<h2>Benefits and Drawbacks</h2>

<P>Benefits and drawbacks are very similar to those of <page_anchor
ID="1047">XML output</page_anchor>. However, JSON is easier to parse,
and some programming languages can directly handle JSON.


</page>



<page ID="1048">

<h2>Benefits</h2>

<P>Benefits include:</P>

<UL>

  <LI><P>Simpler in its syntax.  Can be parsed even with AWK.</P>

  <LI><P>Less verbose, which may constitute a performance gain on
  really slow hardware.</P>

</UL>


<h2>Drawbacks</h2>

<P>Drawbacks include:</P>

<UL>

  <LI><P>Less robust error-handling.  Is meant for human reading, not
  for parsing by machines.</P>

  <LI><P>Does not tell you when a statement has finished or when it is
  being processed.</P>

</UL>

</page>



<page ID="1044">

<P>The mql(1) program has the following exit codes:</P>

<PRE class="code">
 * 0 : Success
 * 1 : Wrong usage
 * 2 : Connection to backend server could not be established
 * 3 : An exception occurred
 * 4 : Could not open file
 * 5 : Database error
 * 6 : Compiler error

<h2>Easy procedure</h2>

<P>As of Emdros version 1.1.11, the easiest way of interfacing with
Emdros is to use the <page_anchor ID="1160">EmdrosEnv</page_anchor>
API.  This sets up all the machinery described in the next
section.</P>

<h2>Full procedure (mostly obsolete: Use EmdrosEnv instead)</h2>

<P>The following instructions are <strong>not necessary to
follow</strong>.  You can simply use the <page_anchor
ID="1160">EmdrosEnv</page_anchor> API.  If you want to know how to do
without it, the following instructions tell you that.

<OL>

  <LI><P>Create an EMdF database object.  This must not be an
  <page_anchor ID="1110">EMdFDB</page_anchor> object, but rather one
  of the descendants matching the back-end you are running:</P>

  <UL>

     <LI><P><page_anchor ID="1110">PgEMdFDB</page_anchor> for a
     PostgreSQL back-end,</P>

     <LI><P><page_anchor ID="1110">MySQLEMdFDB</page_anchor> for a
     MySQL back-end.</P>

     <LI><P><page_anchor ID="1110">SQLiteEMdFDB</page_anchor> for an
     SQLite 2 back-end.</P>

     <LI><P><page_anchor ID="1110">SQLite3EMdFDB</page_anchor> for an
     SQLite 3 back-end.</P>

  </UL>

  <LI><P>Check that the connection is OK with the connectionOk()
  method.  If not, back up and implement an error-recovery strategy of
  your choice.</P>

  <LI><P>Create a <page_anchor ID="1101">EMdFOutput</page_anchor>
  object.  This is for specifying:</P>

  <UL>

     <LI><P>The default encoding (e.g., ISO-8859-1),</P>

     <LI><P>The std::ostream descendant on which output should be
     printed (e.g., std::cout), and</P>

     <LI><P>The output kind (XML, JSON, or Console).</P>

  </UL>


  <LI><P>Create a <page_anchor
  ID="1120">MQLExecEnv</page_anchor> from the EMdF
  database and the EMdFOutput object.</P>

  <LI><P>Use the executing environment to interact with the MQL layer,
  and the EMdF database object to interact with the EMdF layer.</P>

  <LI>When you are done, delete the execution environment and the EMdF
  database object.</P>

</OL>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<P>This page is split up into two sections:</P>

<UL>

  <LI><page_anchor ID="1072">Unix/Linux</page_anchor>,

  <LI><page_anchor ID="1073">Windows</page_anchor>.

</UL>


</page>


<page ID="1072">

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<P>This page gives instructions about which libraries to use on
Unix/Linux, and how to use them.  But first, some background.</P>

<h2>Background</h2>

<P>On Unix, there are two kinds of libraries:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>static, and 
  <LI>shared.
</UL>

<P>Static libraries normally end in ".a", while shared libraries
normally end in ".so".</P>

<P>A library named "foo" will generally have a "lib" prefix, so it
will be either:</P>

<UL>
  <LI><strong>libfoo.a</strong> (if static), or
  <LI><strong>libfoo.so</strong> (if shared)
</UL>

<h2>How to link</h2>

<h3>What</h3>

<P>When linking your application, you will need to pass a number of
switches to the linker.  How this is done depends on your compiler
and/or linker.</P>

<P>Generally speaking, the <strong>-l</strong> switch tells the linker
to link in a certain library.  So <strong>-lfoo</strong> links in the
<strong>foo</strong> library.</P>

<P>Most linkers will choose a shared library over a static one by
default, so -lfoo will link in libfoo.so if it is present.</P>

<h3>Where</h3>

<P>In addition, the linker will need to know where to search for the
libraries.  Generally speaking, this is done with the
<strong>-L</strong> switch.  So</P>

<pre class="code">
-L/usr/local/lib/emdros
</PRE><!-- widthincm : 12 -->

<P>will tell the linker to look in the /usr/local/lib/emdros
directory.</P>

<h3>LDFLAGS</h3>

<P>The conventional way of doing this in Makefiles is to set the
<strong>LDFLAGS</strong> variable to the string of switches that is
necessary.</P>

<h3>Order matters</h3>

<P>The order in which you specify these options usually
matters. Generally speaking, -L switches should come before -l
switches, and dependent libraries should come before libraries on
which they are dependent.</P>

<h2>Which libraries to use</h2>

<h3>Always</h3>

<P>You will <strong>always</strong> need the following library:</P>

<pre class="code">
-lemdf
</PRE><!-- widthincm : 12 -->

<h3>PostgreSQL</h3>

<P>If using <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, you will also need the
following library:</P>

<pre class="code">
-lpq
</PRE><!-- widthincm : 12 -->

<P>libpq is a PostgreSQL library.</P>


<h3>MySQL</h3>

<P>If using <strong>MySQL</strong>, you will also need the
following library:</P>

<pre class="code">
-lmysqlclient
</PRE><!-- widthincm : 12 -->

<P>In addition, you will probably need to tell the linker where to
find the mysqlclient library.  It is probably located in
/usr/lib/mysql:</P>

<pre class="code">
-L/usr/lib/mysql -lmysqlclient
</PRE><!-- widthincm : 12 -->

<P>In addition, you may find that libmysqlclient depends on libz.  So
you may need to do the following:</P>

<pre class="code">
-L/usr/lib/mysql -lmysqlclient -lz
</PRE><!-- widthincm : 12 -->

<P>libmysqlclient is a MySQL library.</P>


<h3>SQLite 2</h3>

<P>If using <strong>SQLite 2</strong>, you will also need the
following library:</P>

<pre class="code">

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<P>This page describes how to set up your linker on Linux so that it
finds the Emdros shared libraries.</P>

<h2>ld.so</h2>

<P>The ld.so(8) linker is the system component responsible for linking
in shared libraries.  By default, it looks in a number of standard
directories for shared libraries.  There are two ways to configure
this:</P>

<UL>

  <LI>Edit the /etc/ld.so.conf file by adding the directories that
  should be searched, or

  <LI>Set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to point to the
  directories that should be searched in addition to the ones in
  /etc/ldd.conf.

</UL>

<h2>Setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH</h2>

<P>In order to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable, you can do the
following (in the bash shell):</P>

<pre class="code">
export LD{PREUNDERSCORE}LIBRARY{PREUNDERSCORE}PATH="$LD{PREUNDERSCORE}LIBRARY{PREUNDERSCORE}PATH:/usr/local/lib/emdros"

<h2>Attribution</h2>

<P>The following was contributed by Prof. Dr. Kirk E. Lowery,
klowery{at}grovescenterPARIS.edu.  (remove French city).</P>

<h2>Shared Library Fundamentals</h2>


<P>Libraries first came about when complex programs organized function
calls in logical groupings. With the advent of GUIs and
object-oriented programming, functions began to be designed for use by
many programs, and so needed grouping conveniently together into one
file of object modules produced by the compiler.</P>


<P>These libraries are called "static" libraries and, on Linux
systems, usually carry the "a" extension, e.g., libemdf.a. A
programmer wishing to use the functions in a particular library uses
the syntax of the function call documented in the header file, e.g.,
monads.h, called the "Application Program Interface (API)". At link
time, the linker makes a copy of the desired functions binary code,
and includes it in the final executable binary of the application
program. Such a program is called "statically" linked, and is
independent of the presence of the original static library. The
program can be used on any compatible system whether or not the static
library is present, since the program carries all needed code within
itself.</P>


<P>As operating systems became more complex, and especially with the
appearance of client-server technology, hard disks and RAM became
cluttered with many copies of the same functions. Application program
binaries were increasing in size by whole orders of magnitude. In
order to improve effeciency the concept of "shared" libraries was
created.</P>


<P>The idea of a shared library is simple: code that is used by more
than one application needs to reside only *once* on the hard disk and
in memory. And it does not need to be loaded into memory until called
for. It can even be removed from memory if deemed necessary.</P>


<P>For an application such as Emdros, the necessity for and advantages
of shared libraries are obvious. Emdros is intended to work with
databases, standing in between a client application and the database
server itself. Such an environment is inherently multi-tasking and
multi-user. The more basic of emdros' function calls (e.g., the
creation and manipulation of monads, or mql queries) will be used
thousands of time during the session of one user. We don't want
thousands of copies of dozens of functions filling up memory, and once
the overhead of calling a function and copying it into memory is paid,
we don't want to have to pay it over and over again.</P>


<h2>Using and Linking with Shared Libraries</h2>


<P>Let's use the example of Emdros' own application program that uses
the Emdros libraries: mql (or, under Windows: mql.exe). Here is a code
snippet from mql.cpp where an emdros library function is used:</P>


<pre class="code">
// Make EMdFOutput
EMdFOutput *pOut = new EMdFOutput(kCSISO{PREUNDERSCORE}8859{PREUNDERSCORE}1, {PREAMP}std::cout, output{PREUNDERSCORE}kind);
</PRE><!-- widthincm : 12 -->


<P>A new instance of the object EMdFOutput is created here and given the
name pOut. Accompanying this object are a set of methods (or,
functions) which can be used with this object. We don't need to know
the details of how EMdFOutput does its magic. All we need to know is
found in emdf_output.h:</P>


<pre class="code">
class EMdFOutput {
protected:
  eCharsets m{PREUNDERSCORE}charset;
  eOutputKind m{PREUNDERSCORE}output{PREUNDERSCORE}kind;
  std::ostream *m{PREUNDERSCORE}pStream;
  int m{PREUNDERSCORE}current{PREUNDERSCORE}indent;
  int m{PREUNDERSCORE}indent{PREUNDERSCORE}chars;
public:
  EMdFOutput(eCharsets charset, std::ostream *pStream, 
              eOutputKind output{PREUNDERSCORE}kind, int indent{PREUNDERSCORE}chars = 3);
  ~EMdFOutput();
  // Getting
  eOutputKind getOutputKind(void) const { return m{PREUNDERSCORE}output{PREUNDERSCORE}kind; }
  // Output
  void increaseIndent();
  void decreaseIndent();
  void out(std::string s);
  void outCharData(std::string s);
  void newline();
  void flush() { *m{PREUNDERSCORE}pStream {PRELT}{PRELT} std::flush; };
  // XML members
  void printXMLDecl();
  void printDTDstart(std::string root{PREUNDERSCORE}element);
  void printDTDend();
  void startTag(std::string name, bool newline{PREUNDERSCORE}before = false);
  // Must have pairs of (attribute name, attribute value)
  void startTag(std::string name, const AttributePairList{PREAMP} 
                 attributes, bool newline{PREUNDERSCORE}before = false); 
  // for tags of type {PRELT}tag/{PREGT}
  void startSingleTag(std::string name, bool newline{PREUNDERSCORE}before = false); 
  // for tags of type {PRELT}tag/{PREGT}
  void startSingleTag(std::string name, const AttributePairList{PREAMP} 
                 attributes, bool newline{PREUNDERSCORE}before = false); 
  void endTag(std::string name, bool newline{PREUNDERSCORE}before = false);
protected:
  void emitAttributes(const AttributePairList{PREAMP} attributes);
};
</PRE><!-- widthincm : 12 -->


<P>This API tells us all we need in order to create instances of
objects of this class, what information we need to give to it, what
kind of information we can expect from it, and what functions we can
use to manipulate it.</P>


<P>In order to compile the mql application program we issue the
command:</P>


<pre class="code">
g++ -g -o .libs/mql mql.o  -L/usr/local/src/emdros/EMdF {PREBACKSLASH}
                           -L/usr/local/src/emdros/MQL {PREBACKSLASH}
                           -L/usr/local/src/emdros/pcre {PREBACKSLASH}
          /usr/local/src/emdros/MQL/.libs/libmql.so -lpcre{PREUNDERSCORE}emdros {PREBACKSLASH}
          /usr/local/src/emdros/EMdF/.libs/libemdf.so {PREBACKSLASH}
             -lpq -Wl,--rpath -Wl,/usr/local/lib/emdros
</PRE><!-- widthincm : 12 -->


<P>The compiler is told the name of the object output file (mql.o),
where to place it in the source tree before installation (.libs/mql),
and to include debugging information (-g). The "-L" option tells g++
where to find libraries to link to, and the "-l" option tells it which
libraries it is to link against, looking for a "libpcre_emdros.a" in
the case of "-lpcre_emdros". This is correct, since the pcre library
is not compiled as shared, but are linked statically into library
functions that need it. In the case of the other libraries, the ".so"
extention (Shared Objects) tells the linker that we want to link
against these "dynamically," not "statically". "pq" stands for the
"postgresql" libraries, which is the database backend chosen for this
installation of emdros. "--rpath" is the "runtime path" that will be
used to find the shared libraries as the program is executing.</P>


<P>If you are using the GNU Autobuild tools (autoconf, automake,
libtool) -- and if you are not, you should be! -- then the following
lines in your Makefile.am will generate the above command, assuming
you have properly created the top-level configure.in file:</P>


<pre class="code">
bin{PREUNDERSCORE}PROGRAMS = mql
mql{PREUNDERSCORE}LDADD = -L../EMdF -L../MQL -L../pcre -lmql @EMDFLDADD@
mql{PREUNDERSCORE}DEPENDENCIES = @EMDFDEPS@ ../pcre/libpcre{PREUNDERSCORE}emdros.a ../MQL/libmql.la
mql{PREUNDERSCORE}SOURCES = mql.cpp
INCLUDES = -I../include
CLEANFILES = *~ core .deps/*
AM{PREUNDERSCORE}CXXFLAGS = @CXXFLAGS@ @DEBUGFLAG@
</PRE><!-- widthincm : 12 -->


<P>Note how libmql is to be linked as a shared library so it is listed
as "libmql.la" whereas libpcre_emdros is listed as "libpcre_emdros.a"
for static linking.</P>


<P>It is beyond the scope of this HOWTO to get into all the details of
the Autobuild tools, but the reader is referred not just to the
excellent documentation that comes along with the software, but also
to the highly recommended tutorial "The AutoBook"</P>

<h2>Making Your Own Shared Library</h2>


<P>Creating a shared library is pretty straightforward. But I am not
going to talk about how to do it manually without using the Autobuild
tools, particularly libtool. Unless your situation is trivially
simple, libtool makes your life so much easier. I am going to use my
experience in modifying the emdros distribution to build shared
libraries in addition to the static ones. To make matters even more
simple, I will concentrate on just one library: libemdf.</P>


<P>There are two files that concern us in the task. First is
configure.in in the top-level emdros directory. The second is
EMdF/Makefile.am. I will note the elements needed for building the
libraries only.</P>


<P>In configure.in, we need the following:</P>


<pre class="code">
dnl Library versioning
dnl We begin with 0:0:0
LIB{PREUNDERSCORE}CURRENT=0
LIB{PREUNDERSCORE}REVISION=0
LIB{PREUNDERSCORE}AGE=0
AC{PREUNDERSCORE}SUBST(LIB{PREUNDERSCORE}CURRENT)
AC{PREUNDERSCORE}SUBST(LIB{PREUNDERSCORE}REVISION)
AC{PREUNDERSCORE}SUBST(LIB{PREUNDERSCORE}AGE)


dnl Invoke libtool
AC{PREUNDERSCORE}PROG{PREUNDERSCORE}LIBTOOL


dnl
dnl Set EMDFLDADD and EMDFDEPS
dnl
if test "x$BACKEND" = "xpostgresql"; then
  EMDFLDADD="-lemdf -lpq";
  EMDFDEPS="../EMdF/libemdf.la";
else
  EMDFLDADD="-lemdf -lmysqlclient";
  EMDFDEPS="../EMdF/libemdf.la";
fi
</PRE><!-- widthincm : 12 -->

<P>Let's deal with the easy stuff first. In order to use libtool, we
need to tell autoconf that it is going to be used, with the macro
AC_PROG_LIBTOOL. We don't need AC_PROG_RANLIB used for static
libraries, because libtool handles all that. Because we have a choice
of database backends, emdros needs to be told which database it will
be used with, and the appropriate emdros libraries to be linked
in. These dependencies get propagated down to the lower level
makefiles, such as the EMdF subdirectory.</P>


<h2>Library Versioning</h2>


<P>Now a more complex but essential subject is library
versioning. Because many libraries form the foundation of many other
libraries and programs, e.g., libc, and because these libraries are in
constant development and change, a protocol was created to allow
multiple versions of the same shared library to exist on the same
system, so that application programs (and, indeed, the kernel) can
have the version of libraries against which they were compiled. So now
the question is, when does one need more than one version of a
library? The answer is, when the API changes. If the API does not
change, then the application program doesn't care particularly if
something "under the hood" changes.</P>


<P>Library versions track the *interface*, which is a set of three
entry points into the library. These entry points are arranged in a
hierarchy:</P>

<pre class="code">
current interface:revision number:age number
</PRE><!-- widthincm : 12 -->


<P>The current interface documents a specific way the library
functions are called. That means if there is any addition to the
library functions, or changes in the way those functions are called,
the data type of their parameters, etc., then the interface number of
the library must change. If any revisions to the source code of the
library is made by fixing bugs, improving performance, even adding
functionality (e.g., more rigorous tests made of input data), *but*
the prototype of the library functions has not changed, then this is a
*revision* of the *current* interface, and the middle number is
incremented. The runtime loader will always use the highest revision
number of the current interface. Finally, the age number tells us how
many previous interfaces are supersets of earlier interfaces, i.e.,
how many earlier interfaces can be linked by binaries. The age must
always be less than or equal to the current interface number.</P>


<P>Quoting from AutoBook, here are the rules for incrementing these
three numbers:</P>


<OL>

   <LI> If you have changed any of the sources for this library, the
      revision number must be incremented. This is a new revision of
      the current interface.


   <LI> If the interface has changed, then current must be incremented,
      and revision reset to `0'. This is the first revision of a new
      interface.


   <LI> If the new interface is a superset of the previous interface
      (that is, if the previous interface has not been broken by the
      changes in this new release), then age must be incremented. This
      release is backwards compatible with the previous release.


   <LI> If the new interface has removed elements with respect to the
      previous interface, then you have broken backward compatibility
      and age must be reset to `0'. This release has a new, but
      backwards incompatible interface.

</OL>

<P>Thus, in our example above, since this is the first interface for the
shared libraries, it receives the number 0. There are no revisions for
this new interface, so revision=0 and age must be 0. Here is a very
important principle:</P>


<center><P><strong> THE SOFTWARE RELEASE VERSION<br>
AND THE SHARED LIBRARY VERSION NUMBERING SCHEMES<br>
HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH EACH OTHER!</strong></P></center>


<P>Even though emdros is at Release 1.1.7 when shared libraries
support was added, the numbering scheme of the libraries is 0:0:0 and
is independent of the release numbers. The library versioning *must*
conform to the four rules listed above. If other parts of emdros are
changed, but not the libraries, then the library verions remain the
same.</P>


<P>Finally, the AC_SUBST macro exports the values of the library versions
for substitution in lower-level makefiles.</P>


<h2>The Final Step</h2>


<P>The code for the libemdf library itself is found in
EMdF/Makefile.am:</P>


<pre class="code">
pkglib{PREUNDERSCORE}LTLIBRARIES = libemdf.la
libemdf{PREUNDERSCORE}la{PREUNDERSCORE}SOURCES = conn.cpp {PREBACKSLASH}
       emdf{PREUNDERSCORE}wstring.cpp {PREBACKSLASH}
       emdfdb.cpp {PREBACKSLASH}
       utils.cpp {PREBACKSLASH}
       inst.cpp {PREBACKSLASH}
       monads.cpp {PREBACKSLASH}
       infos.cpp {PREBACKSLASH}
       table.cpp {PREBACKSLASH}
       string{PREUNDERSCORE}func.cpp {PREBACKSLASH}
       inst{PREUNDERSCORE}object.cpp {PREBACKSLASH}
       emdf{PREUNDERSCORE}output.cpp
libemdf{PREUNDERSCORE}la{PREUNDERSCORE}LDFLAGS = -version-info @LIB{PREUNDERSCORE}CURRENT@:@LIB{PREUNDERSCORE}REVISION@:@LIB{PREUNDERSCORE}AGE@
</PRE><!-- widthincm : 12 -->

<P>First, we tell automake about our library: we want it installed in
the "package" directory for libraries (/usr/local/lib/emdros in this
case), that the following list of of libraries are to be made in both
static and shared versions, using the "la" extension name. The next
macro tells automake what source files are to be used for building
libemdf.la. Finally, we tell automake about the version of the
library.</P>


<P>That's it, believe it or not! Automake and libtool handle all the
rest. Simply invoke the compile. For example:</P>


<pre class="code">
aclocal {PREAMP}{PREAMP} automake --add-missing {PREAMP}{PREAMP} autoconf {PREAMP}{PREAMP} ./configure {PREAMP}{PREAMP} make install
</PRE><!-- widthincm : 12 -->

<P>Now do you see why we so strongly recommend the Autobuild tools?
Yes, we thought so! :-)</P>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<P>The EMdF database classes are structured in the following
hierarchy:</P>

<UL>

  <LI>EMdFDB

  <UL>

     <LI>PgEMdFDB

     <LI>MySQLEMdFDB

     <LI>SQLiteEMdFDB (for SQLite 2)

     <LI>SQLite3EMdFDB (for SQLite 3)

  </UL>

</UL>

<h2>Boolean return value</h2>

<P>For the functions which return a boolean, the return value
generally means the following:</P>

<UL>

  <LI>true: No error.

  <LI>false: An error occurred.  Use the error interface to get to
  know what the error was.  The values of any reference parameters
  which should have returned something are undefined.

</UL>

<P>The only exceptions to this rule are the <page_anchor
ID="1115">transaction interface</page_anchor> methods and the
ConnectionOk() method.</P>

<h2>Special 'emdf' database name</h2>

<P>All of the backends recognize the special database name 'emdf'
(without the quotes).  This is a valid database name, but will not
associate the connection with any database.</P>

<P>Hence, you can use 'emdf' as a default database name used until you
issue a 'USE DATABASE' MQL statement or call the EMdFDB::useDatabase()
method.</P>

<P>On PostgreSQL, the user is actually connected to the 'template1'
database.</P>

<P>On MySQL, the user is connected with no default associated database.</P>

<P>On SQLite (2 and 3), the user is not connected to any database.</P>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<P>Transactions are implemented for PostgreSQL and SQLite (2 and 3)
only.  The MySQL interface returns false on all three member
functions.</P>

<P>The beginTransaction member function is special in that its return
value, though boolean, does not mean "success/error".  Instead, the
return value means the following:</P>

<UL>

  <LI>true: The transaction was started,

  <LI>false: The transaction was not started.

</UL>

<P>The other two functions, commitTransaction and abortTransaction,
follow the normal pattern of returning true on success, false on
error.</P>

<P>The following are the other arguments, common to them all:</P>

<UL>

  <LI>pEE is the <page_anchor ID="1120">execution

  <LI>bResult&amp; is a boolean reference returning true on success and
  false on error.

  <LI>bPrintResult is a boolean indicating whether the results should
  be dumped using the <page_anchor ID="1101">EMdFOutput</page_anchor>
  object in the execution environment (true) or not (false).  Set this
  to false if you plan to use the <page_anchor

<h2>Overview</h2>

<P>The Statement class is the base class for all MQL statements.  It
contains the <page_anchor ID="1139">MQLResult</page_anchor> object
associated with each execution of a statement.</P>

<p>When executing more than one statement at a time in a single call
to <page_anchor ID="1160">EmdrosEnv</page_anchor>::executeXXX or
<page_anchor ID="1130">mqlExecuteXXX</page_anchor>, only the results
from the last statement executed are available afterwards.  Executing
more than one query is mostly used when parsing the output from the

<h2>Overview</h2>

<P>The sheaf is the datastructure returned by the "SELECT (ALL|FOCUS)
OBJECTS" query.  See the MQL User's Guide Chapter 4 for a description
of the sheaf.</P>

<P>Briefly, a <strong>sheaf</strong> is a list of straws.  A
<strong>straw</strong> is a list of matched_objects.  A
<strong>matched_object</strong> may have an inner sheaf, which makes
the datastructure recursive.</P>

<P>A matched_object corresponds to an object_block(_first) or
(opt_)gap_block in a topographic MQL query.  A straw corresponds to a
block_string.  A sheaf corresponds to a blocks.</P>

<P>A matched_object may be one of two kinds:</P>

<UL>

  <LI>kMOKID_D : Match of object_block(_first)
  <LI>kMOKID_M : Match of (opt_)gap_block

</UL>

<P>Use the getKind() method to find out which it is, if you don't
already know from the query.</P>

<P>A matched_object contains the following information:</P>

<UL>

  <LI>An eMOKind enumeration (either kMOKID_D or KMOKID_M)

  <LI>An id_d (valid if the eMOKind enumeration is kMOKID_D)

  <LI>An object type (valid if the eMOKind enumeration is kMOKID_D)

  <LI>A set of monads (always valid)

  <LI>A focus boolean (always valid)

  <LI>A "marks" string (always valid, but may be empty)

  <LI>An inner sheaf (always valid)

  <LI>A vector of EMdFValue values, non-empty if the object block had
  a GET clause.

<h2>Example</h2>

<P>The iterators are used like this:</P>

<pre class="code">

  Sheaf *pSheaf; // Assumed to be initialized from somewhere
  SheafConstIterator sci = pSheaf->const{PREUNDERSCORE}iterator();
  while (sci.hasNext()) {
    const Straw *pStraw = sci.current();
   
    // Process pStraw ...

    sci.next();
  }

  // Or like this:
  SheafIterator si = pSheaf->iterator();
  while (si.hasNext()) {
    Straw *pStraw = si.next();
   
    // Process pStraw ...

    // Note how there is no si.next() again, since next() 
    // first gets current element and then advances iterator.

    // NOTE: This is also possible with the const iterators.

<h2>Ways you can benefit</h2>

<P>Emdros is for storing and retrieving analyzed or annotated text.
As such, you are likely to benefit from Emdros in at least one of the
following ways:</P>

<UL>

  <LI>Ways you can build an Emdros database:

     <UL>

        <LI><P>You have an existing text database which you want to
             import into Emdros.</P>

        <LI><P>You want to build a database "on the fly" using
            analyses or annotations you are making.</P>

     </UL>

  <LI>Ways you can use an Emdros database:

     <UL>

         <LI><P>You can display the database contents as they are,
         based on selection criteria which you make up.</P>

         <LI><P>You can search the database and display the
         results.</P>

     </UL>

</UL>

<P>How you build your application will depend on which of these four
goals you have (one or more of them).</P>

<h2>Use MQL</h2>

<P>The easiest way of writing any application on top of Emdros is
probably to take advantage of the MQL language, rather than dealing
with the EMdF layer directly.  MQL is quite powerful, and allows you
to do most things you would want to do with Emdros.  Thus however you
architect your application, plan on using the MQL User's Guide
extensively.</P>

<page ID="1220">

<p>In order to populate a database, go through the following
steps:</P>

<OL>

  <LI><P>Create a schema file which contains MQL statements which
      create all the enumerations and object types and features
      necessary.  Use the CREATE ENUMERATION and CREATE OBJECT TYPE
      statements for this.  See the MQL User's Guide for how to use
      these statements.  The schema file should contain a CREATE
      DATABASE statement and a USE DATABASE statement at the top of
      the file.</P>

  <LI><P>Run this schema file through the mql(1) program.</P>

  <LI><P>Populate the database.  This can be done in two ways:</P>

  <OL>

    <LI><P>Write and run a program which takes any existing data and

        particular, use the CREATE OBJECT FROM MONADS statement, or

  things, and</P>

  <LI><P><page_anchor ID="1225">PostgreSQL-specific</page_anchor>
  things.</P>

</UL>


</page>



<page ID="1224">

<h2>Use CREATE OBJECTS WITH OBJECT TYPE</h2>

<P>In general, it is faster to use CREATE OBJECTS WITH OBJECT TYPE
rather than CREATE OBJECT FROM MONADS.  On my machine, it is between 7
and 10 times faster, depending on the backend.</P>

<P>One drawback of CREATE OBJECTS WITH OBJECT TYPE is that you can't
get the object id_d back immediately.  You would have to query the
database (e.g., using SELECT OBJECTS HAVING MONADS IN) to find out the
object id_ds of the newly created objects.</P>

<P>If your application requires complex interaction between objects,
e.g., setting features based on other objects' id_ds, it may be easier
(but certainly not faster) to use CREATE OBJECT FROM MONADS.</P>


<h2>Drop indexes</h2>

<P>In order to speed up queries, one thing you can do is to issue a
</P>

<pre class="code">
  {PREDOLLAR} manage{PREUNDERSCORE}indices --drop databasename
</PRE><!-- widthincm : 12 -->

<P>command on the command-line before starting the program which
populates the database.  Then, once all creation has taken place, you
can issue the command:</P>

<pre class="code">
  {PREDOLLAR} manage{PREUNDERSCORE}indices --create databasename
</PRE><!-- widthincm : 12 -->

<P>in order to recreate the indices.  See the manage_indices(1) manual
page for more information.</P>

<P>You can also use the MQL statements DROP INDEXES and CREATE
INDEXES.  See the MQL User's Guide for more information.</P>

</page>



<page ID="1225">

<P>You can also issue a VACUUM command on the database after each part
of the database has been loaded, or even while loading the database.
The latter can be done in one of two ways:</P>

<OL>

  <LI><P>Either with the MQL "VACUUM DATABASE" statement, or</P>

  <LI><P>With the <page_anchor ID="1110">EMdFDB</page_anchor>::Vacuum

       database</page_anchor> with this information.</P>

   <LI><P>Display the in-memory EMdF database on-screen in a scrolling
       view, or dump results to a file or stdout.</P>

</OL>

<P>Next, we describe the design of such an in-memory EMdF database.</P>

</page>



<page ID="1235">

<h2>Benefits</h2>

<P>Building an in-memory EMdF database has the advantage of being close
to the EMdF model, and thus to the data you get back.  Also, we have
found the EMdF model to be quite powerful when manipulating and
displaying data in-memory.</P>

<h2>Necessary operations</h2>

<P>Here are some operations you will likely need:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Database operations
  <UL>
     <LI>Get object(s) of a given object type at a given monad.
     <LI>Get object by id_d
     <LI>Insert object into database
     <LI>Delete object from database
  </UL>
  <LI>Object operations
  <UL>
     <LI>Create object
     <LI>Delete object
     <LI>Get feature value
     <LI>Set feature value
  </UL>

</UL>

</page>



<page ID="1236">

<P>With these operations, you will be able to construct most other
operations you may need.  For example, if your application domain uses
an immediate constituent model, one way of modeling this is to have,
in each object type, a feature called "parent", which is an id_d
pointing to the parent object.  Then a number of desirable operations
can easily be implemented in terms of the above operations:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Get immediate constituents of object
  <LI>Get parent of object
  <LI>Get siblings (through judicious use of the two above operations)
  <LI>is_c_commanding (a boolean)
</UL>

<P>etc. etc.</P>

<page ID="1237">

<P>One strategy for implementing an in-memory EMdF database (using C++
terminology as an example) would be the following:</P>

<UL>

  <LI><P>Have a class which encapsulates the database.</P>

  <LI><P>Have a class which encapsulates object types.  Each object
      type should encapsulate the features it has, as well as their
      types.  Associate each object type with an object type id and
      store these in the database class.</P>

  <LI><P>Have a class called, e.g., CMonad_d (for "database monad").
      This represents a monad_m, and has, for each object type, a list
      of the object id_ds of the objects which have this monad.  In
      the database class, use either an array or an associative map
      (e.g., std::map) which associates each monad_m with its
      CMonad_d.</P>

  <LI><P>Have a class which encapsulates objects, their monads, and
      their feature values.  You can choose either to make the class
      generic, capable of handling all object types, or to subclass it
      for each object type in your application domain.</P>

  <LI><P>For each object type, use some sort of associative map (e.g.,
      std::map) which maps id_ds to pointers to object objects, and
      put these in the database class.  You may wish to put all of the
      objects in one big map, regardless of object type.</P>

<p>Part IV is about the "harvest" library that has been part of Emdros since
version 3.0.2.</p>

<p><b>WARNING:</b> This library is not yet fully documented, though
all parts are ready for prime-time use.</P>

</page>

<page ID="1410">

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>The purpose of the harvest library is to assist in retrieving and
displaying objects from an Emdros database.</p>

<p>For the moment, there are four components to the Emdros "harvest"
library:</p>

<OL>

  <LI><p>A "RenderObjects" class, which supports reading of objects into
  memory, producing a document from the objects read.  The document can be
  XML-based, but need not be.</p>

  <LI><p>A "RenderXML" module, which supports SAX-parser-based parsing of XML
  and rendering into something else, probably HTML.</p>

  <LI><p>A "full text search" module (harvest_fts).</p>

  <LI><p>A "full text search version 2" module
  (harvest_fts2).</p>

</OL>

<p>The idea is to use the "RenderObjects" module for retrieving the objects
from an Emdros database.  These objects are then rendered into a document by
the "RenderObjects" module, according to a pre-defined model, and driven by a
user-supplied "stylesheet" telling the "RenderObjects" engine what to do.  The
output of this process is a document, i.e., a string containing a
representation of the objects read.  This document may or may not be XML, but
if it is, then the "RenderXML" module may be used to transform the document to
something else.</p>

<p>The idea of the "RenderXML" module is to take the XML produced by
"RenderObjects" and produce something else -- probably HTML, but it could be
any other format.  The output is, again, a document in the form of a string.
Again, a "stylesheet" is used to tell the "RenderXML" what to do.</p>

<h2>JSON stylesheets</h2>

<p>As mentioned, both of the above modules use user-supplied "stylesheets" in
order to know what to do.  These "stylesheets" are based on the JSON data
interchange language.</p>

<p>For more information about JSON, please visit:</p>

<p>http://www.json.org</p>

<p>JSON is a very simple language, and should be easy to learn.  An
implementation of JSON is provided in the libemdf library, so no
external dependencies are needed for this.</p>



</page>



<page ID="1420">

<h2>JSON</h2>

<p>JSON is a simple data interchange language.  It is easy for humands to read
and write.  It is also easy for machines to parse and generate.</p>

<p>JSON builds on three kinds of data structures:</p>

<UL>

  <LI><strong>Objects</strong>: An <em>object</em> in JSON is an unordered set
  of key/value pairs.

  <LI><strong>Arrays</strong>: An <em>array</em> in JSON is an ordered list of
  values.

  <LI><strong>Values</strong>: A <em>value</em> in JSON is one of the
  following kinds:

  <UL>

        <LI><strong>null</strong>: A JSON value which is used to mean "no
        value".

        <LI><strong>true</strong>: A JSON value which is used to mean "the
        Boolean value 'true'".

        <LI><strong>false</strong>: A JSON value which is used to mean "the
        Boolean value 'false'".

        <LI><strong>string</strong>: A JSON value which denotes a string.  It
        is enclosed in "double quotes", and may contain "escape characters".
        For a full list of escape characters, please see below.

        <LI><strong>number</strong>: A JSON value which denotes a
        number.  In real JSON, these numbers can be both integers and
        floating-point numbers.  In the implementation present in
        Emdros, they can only be the integers (positive and negative,
        as well as 0).  Thus, floating-point numbers cannot be
        represented in the JSON implementation in Emdros.

        <LI><strong>object</strong>: A JSON object.  Note that this entails
        that JSON objects may contain JSON objects, just as JSON arrays may
        contain JSON objects.

        <LI><strong>array</strong>: A JSON array.  Note that this entails that
        JSON arrays may contain JSON arrays, just as JSON objects may contain
        JSON arrays.

  </UL>

</UL>

<h2>Escape codes</h2>

<p>In JSON, strings are surrounded by "double quotes".  Inside the
double quotes, one may place "escape characters", which map to other
characters.  The ones present in Emdros's JSON are:</p>

<UL>

  <LI><strong>\"</strong>: maps to "

  <LI><strong>\\</strong>: maps to \

  <LI><strong>\b</strong>: maps to "bell" (control character 0x07)

  <LI><strong>\f</strong>: maps to "form feed" (control character 0x0c)

  <LI><strong>\n</strong>: maps to "newline" (control character 0x0a)

  <LI><strong>\r</strong>: maps to "carriage return" (control character 0x0d)

  <LI><strong>\t</strong>: maps to "horizontal tab" (control character 0x09)

  <LI><strong>\x[A-Fa-f0-9][A-Fa-f0-9]</strong>: Maps to the 8-bit
  number expressed by the hexadecimal number after the \x.  Note that
  this is a departure from "real" JSON, where 8-bit characters are not
  supported.

  <LI><strong>\u[A-Fa-f0-9][A-Fa-f0-9][A-Fa-f0-9][A-Fa-f0-9]</strong>:
  Maps to the 16-bit Unicode code point expressed by the hexadecimal
  number after the \u.

</UL>

<page ID="1430">

<h2>Input to RenderObjects</h2>

<p>The "RenderObjects" class constructor takes as input:</p>

<UL>

  <LI>An EmdrosEnv object, already connected to a database.  The
  EmdrosEnv must return true when calling connectionOk().

  <LI>A database name. This is just a way of identifying the database
  within the engine, and need not have anything to do with the actual
  database name connected to by the EmdrosEnv.

  <LI>A JSONValue called "pFetchInfo" which must be a JSON object which
  contains the stylesheet or stylesheets to use.

  <LI>A string containing the name of the stylesheet to use from the
  pFetchInfo JSON object.

</UL>

<p>The "process" method of the RenderObjects class takes as input a starting
monad and an ending monad.  The stretch of monads specified here is used to
retrieve the objects, so all objects to be retrieved must be found within the
confines of this stretch of monads.</p>

<h2>Output</h2>

<p>The output from RenderObjects is a document in the form a string.  The
document can be retrieved with the "getDocument()" method of a RenderObjects
object.</p>

</page>

<page ID="1431">


<h2>Stylesheet structure</h2>

<p>The "pFetchInfo" JSONValue object passed to the constructor must
contain at least one "fetch stylesheet".  It may also contain at most
one "dictionaries" key.</p>

<p>The "dictionaries" key, when present, must point to a JSON object
which maps strings to JSON objects, which in turn map strings to
strings (only).  It is used for looking up things in a dictionary with
a special template tag called "dictlookup".</p>

<p>Moreover, the name of the stylesheet passed in the last parameter
to the constructor must be present in the pFetchInfo JSON object as a
key, which names a "fetch stylesheet". The value of this key must, in
turn, be a JSON object.  This JSON object must, in turn, contain at
least the key, "object_types". It may also contain the keys
"priority_list", "postprocess", and "prepend_XML_declaration".</p>

<p>The "object_types" key must point to a JSON object.</p>

<p>The "priority_list" key, when present, must point to a list of JSON
strings.</p>

<p>The "postprocess" key, when present, must point to a list of JSON
objects. It is used for doing any post-processing after the
renderobjects process proper has finished.</p>

<p>The "prepend_XML_declaration" key, when present, must point to a
JSON Boolean.  Unless this is present, and false, the following string
is prepended to the output: "<strong>&lt;?xml version='1.0'
encoding='utf-8'?&gt;</strong>". Thus you can turn off this "feature"
by having this key/value pair in your stylesheet:</p>

<pre class="code">
       "prepend{PREUNDERSCORE}XML{PREUNDERSCORE}declaration" : false,
</pre><!-- widthincm : 12 -->

<p>For examle, the following would be the beginnings of a "fetch
stylesheet", with one stylesheet called "base":</p>

<pre class="code">
{PREOPENBRACE}
   "fetchinfo" : {PREOPENBRACE}
      "base" : {PREOPENBRACE}
         "object_types" : {PREOPENBRACE}
         {PRECLOSEBRACE},
         "priority_list" : [
         ],
         "postprocess" : [
         ],
         "prepend{PREUNDERSCORE}XML{PREUNDERSCORE}declaration" : true,
      {PRECLOSEBRACE}
   {PRECLOSEBRACE}
{PRECLOSEBRACE}
</pre><!-- widthincm : 12 -->

<h2>priority_list</h2>

<p>There are two ways of telling Emdros in which order to process the
objects retrieved.  One is by means of a "document index feature".
Here we describe the priority list.  The document index feature will
be described later.</p>

<p>The "priority_list" must contain a list of JSON strings, each of
which is the name of an object type.  If an object type name occurs in
the "priority_list", it <em>must</em> occur in the "object_types" JSON
object.</p>

<p>The purpose of the "priority_list" is to indicate the order in
which the object types must be processed. (See below for the
processing model.)</p>

<h2>object_types</h2>

<p>The "object_types" JSON object must contain key/value pairs as follows:</p>

<UL>
   <li>Keys: object type names

   <li>Values: A JSON object with the following keys: "start", "end",
   "get", and "docindexfeature".  All of these are optional, but if
   anything is to happen with the objects from the object type, then
   at least one of "start" and "end" must be present.  They are
   explained below.

</UL>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Thus, a simple but complete example of a stylesheet with one "fetch
stylesheet" and the "dictinoaries" key may look like this:</p>

<pre class="code">
{PREOPENBRACE}
   "fetchinfo" : {PREOPENBRACE}
   {PREOPENBRACE}
      "base : {PREOPENBRACE}
         "object_types" : {PREOPENBRACE}
             "document" : {PREOPENBRACE}
                  "start" : "&lt;document id=\"{PREOPENBRACE}{PREOPENBRACE} feature 0 {PRECLOSEBRACE}{PRECLOSEBRACE}\"&gt;&lt;docname&gt;{PREOPENBRACE}{PREOPENBRACE} dictlookup 'documentname' feature 0 'Unknown document' {PRECLOSEBRACE}{PRECLOSEBRACE}&lt;/docname&gt;",
	          "get" : [
	             "documentid"
	          ] 
                  "end" : "&lt;/document&gt;"
              {PRECLOSEBRACE},
              "token" : {PREOPENBRACE}
                   "get" : [ "surface" ],
                   "start" : "&lt;token&gt;{PREOPENBRACE}{PREOPENBRACE} feature 0 {PRECLOSEBRACE}{PRECLOSEBRACE}&lt;/token&gt;"
              {PRECLOSEBRACE},
         {PRECLOSEBRACE},
         "priority_list" : [
            "document",
            "token"
         ],
     {PRECLOSEBRACE},
  {PRECLOSEBRACE}
  "dictionaries" : {PREOPENBRACE}
     "documentname" : {PREOPENBRACE}
         "id123" : "Alice's adventures in wonderland",
         "id456" : "Moby Dick",
     {PRECLOSEBRACE}
  {PRECLOSEBRACE}
{PRECLOSEBRACE}
</pre><!-- widthincm : 12 -->

<h2>Processing model</h2>

<p>The processing model works with objects of all range-types, i.e.,
objects which are either "SINGLE RANGE OBJECTS", "SINGLE MONAD
OBJECTS", or "MULTIPLE RANGE OBJECTS".</p>

<p>The algorithm is as follows:</p>

<OL>

  <LI><p>Start the process by calling RenderObjects::startDocument().
  The default implementation of startDocument() just adds the XML
  declaration to the document.  The user is free to subclass the
  RenderObjects class and reimplement startDocument, thus starting in
  a different way.</p>

  <LI><p>Based on the starting and ending monads given in the
  parameters to the RenderObejcts::process() call, all objects from
  the object types present in the "object_types" JSON object of the
  given "fetch style sheet" are read into memory.  This is done with a
  GET OBJECTS HAVING MONADS IN {OPENBRACE} <em>first_monad</em> -
  <em>last_monad</em> {CLOSEBRACE} MQL statement.</p>

  <LI><p>The objects read into memory are then processed as follows:</p>

      <p>For all monads <em>m</em> between the first monad and the
      last monad:</p>

     <OL>

        <LI><p>Get a list of objects which start at the monad
        <em>m</em>, or which have a monad set element which starts at
        <em>m</em>.  Sort it according to the methods specified below.
        For each object in this sorted list, call the "template"
        specified in the "start" value in the "object_types" JSON
        object for this object type.</p>

        <LI><p>Get a list of objects which end at monad <em>m</em>, or
        which have a monad set element which ends at <em>m</em>.  Sort
        it according to the methods specified below.  For each object
        in this list, call the "template" specified in the "end" value
        in the "object_types" JSON object for this object type.</p>

     </OL>


</OL>

<h2>Sorting methods</h2>

<p>When sorting the lists of objects to start or end at a given monad,
the following two methods can be used:</p>

<OL>

  <LI><strong>priority_list:</strong> <p>If the stylesheet JSON object
  contains a "priority_list" key (as described above), then the list
  is sorted by two keys: First, by the last monad of the Monad Set
  Element which starts at the current monad (in reverse order). And
  second, by the position of the object type in the priority_list JSON
  array.  The effect of this is that objects which start at the same
  monad are opened first if they end later, and, if they end at the
  same monad, are opened first if they are first in the priority_list.
  Thus, if you have a DTD that you want to follow, and element X
  contains element Y in the DTD, you can safely place X before Y in
  the priority_list and assume that everything is printed in the right
  order.</p>

  <p>This is reversed when doing the end-of-Monad-set-element monad.
  That is, the first monad of the monad set element at hand is used as
  the first sorting key, and the length of the priority list MINUS the
  position of the object type in the priority list is used as the
  second sorting key.  Thus, objects which start after other objects
  are closed first, and objects which start at the same monad, but are
  further down in the priority_list are closed first. Again, this is
  so as to ensure that a DTD is followed if element X contains element
  Y, and element X is before element Y in the priority list.</p>

  <LI><strong>document index feature:</strong> <p>The other method
  that can be used to sort the list is to use a "document index
  feature".  The concrete expression of this in the stylesheet is
  given below, under "Object type information".  For now, it is enough
  to know that a document index feature is an integer feature on an
  object which gives, for that object, the priority to be used.  Thus
  it replaces the priority_list.  Indeed, if there is no
  priority_list, then all objects in the object_types JSON object MUST
  have a "docindexfeature" key.  Conversely, if there is a
  "priority_list", then that will be used, regardless of whether any
  object type JSON object has a "docindexfeature" key.</p>

  <p>The "document index feature" must be generated (when you generate
  the database) in such a way that objects with <em>lower</em>
  document index feature values are to be "started" <em>before</em>
  objects with higher document index feature values, and ended
  <em>after</em> objects with higher document index feature
  values.</p>

  <p>Note that the algorithm completely disregards the first and last
  monads of the monad set element in the sorting of those that start
  or end a monad set element at a given monad.  This is because the
  algorithm needs to trust the docindexfeature value completely.</p>

  <p>Note also that this can usefully implemented by "parents": If an
  object has a parent, then that parent's docindexfeature should
  always be lower than any of its children. That way, if it is a tree,
  then the objects will be started and ended in a cleanly nested
  way.</p>

  <p>Note also that if this is a tree (and not a forest of connecected
  trees with a common root), then the parent need not have a globally
  unique docindexfeature.  Instead, the docindexfeature values must be
  locally unique within the tree.</p>

 </OL>

<h2>Object type information</h2>

<p>For each object type in the "object_types" JSON object, the
following four keys may be present:</p>

<UL>

  <LI><strong>get</strong>: If present, this must map to a JSON list of JSON
  strings.  The strings must be features present on the given object type.

  <LI><strong>start</strong>: If present, this must map to a JSON string which
  gives the "template" to be used when starting objects of this object type.

  <LI><strong>end</strong>: If present, this must map to a JSON string which
  gives the "template" to be used when ending objects of this object type.

  <LI><strong>docindexfeature</strong>: If present, the the feature
  named by the value must be an integer, suitable for being used by
  the "document index feature" algorithm described above for
  prioritizing objects.

</UL>

<h2>Templates</h2>

<p>As stated, the "start" and "end" keys must map to JSON strings
which contain "templates".  In the next Section, we describe these
templates.</p>

</page>



<page ID="1440">

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The template language for RenderObjects can be described as
follows.  It is a list of the following kinds of string:</p>

<h2>Basic emitting commands</h2>

<UL>

  <LI><p><strong>{OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} id_d
  {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}</strong>: Emits the id_d of the object under
  consideration.<br/><b>Only available in
  RenderObjects, not RenderXML.</b></p>

  <LI><p><strong>{OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} firstmonad
  {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}</strong>: Emits the first monad of the
  object under consideration.  This is done in base-10, so that if an
  object has a set of objects with first monad "3", then "3" is
  emitted (without the quotes).<br/><b>Only available in
  RenderObjects, not RenderXML.</b></p>

  <LI><p><strong>{OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} lastmonad
  {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}</strong>: Emits the last monad of the
  object under consideration.  This is done in base-10, so that if an
  object has a set of objects with last monad "3", then "3" is
  emitted (without the quotes).<br/><b>Only available in
  RenderObjects, not RenderXML.</b></p>

  <LI><p><strong>{OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} dbname
  {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}</strong>: Emits the database name under
  consideration.  This is the database name given to the constructor
  of the RenderObjects class.<br/><b>Only available in
  RenderObjects, not RenderXML.</b></p>

  <LI><p><strong>{OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} feature <em>integer</em>
  {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}</strong>: Emits the value of the object's
  feature given by the <em>integer</em>'s 0-based index into the list
  of features in the "get" part of the stylesheet for this object
  type.  Thus if the "get" part says '"get" : [ "surface", "suffix"
  ]', and the "start" part says: '"start" : "{OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE}
  feature 1 {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}"', then the value of the object's
  "suffix" feature is emitted.  The feature value is escaped (mangled)
  according to XML rules, such that less-than becomes "&amp;lt;",
  greater-than becomes "&amp;gt;", ampersand becomes "&amp;amp;", and
  "double tuote" becomes "&amp;quot;".<br/><b>Only available in
  RenderObjects, not RenderXML.</b></p>

  <em>integer</em> {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}</strong>: Just like the
  "feature" counterpart just described, except that no XML mangling
  takes place.<br/><b>Only available in RenderObjects, not
  RenderXML.</b></p>

  <LI><p><strong>{OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} counter <em>string</em>
  {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}</strong>: Emits the contents of the
  "counter" within the template execution environment, named by the
  given string.  A counter is simply an integer which has a name, and
  which can be incremented and emitted.  It always starts at 0, so the
  first time you use this, 0 will be emitted, unless you have used
  "inccounter", "deccounter" or "setcounter" first.</p>

  <LI><p><strong>{OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} counter <em>string</em> format
  <em>format-string</em> {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}</strong>: Emits the
  contents of the "counter" within the template execution environment,
  named by the first string, formatted using the format-string.<br/>
  <br/> The format-string is currently limited to the following
  cases. For example:
  
  <UL>
	<LI><p><b>Empty</b> No formatting is done on the integer. It is just printed as a base-10 number.</p>
	
	<LI><p><b>017</b> I.e., a 0-prefixed integer (e.g., 17).
	This makes sure that the number string is at least as long as
	the given integer (e.g., 17 characters long), and padded with
	'0', ASCII 48=0x32.</p>
	
	<LI><p><b>17</b> I.e., a non-0-prefixed integer.  Same as 017,
        except that the padding charater is a space: ASCII 32=0x20.</p>

 	</UL>
  </UL>

<h2>Document control commands</h2>

<UL>

  <LI><p><strong>{OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} setnixing doc
  {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}</strong>: Starts "nixing" the output to the
  document, i.e., no strings are emitted at all to the output. Strings
  are emitted to variables and lists, however. But variables and lists
  are not emitted to the document. This state continues until you use
  "setnixing off" or "setnixing all".</p>

  <LI><p><strong>{OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} setnixing all
  {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}</strong>: Starts "nixing" ALL output to the
  document and to lists and variables, i.e., no strings are emitted at
  all to the output, lists, or variables. This state continues until
  you use "setnixing off" or "setnixing doc".</p>

  <LI><p><strong>{OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} setnixing off
  {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}</strong>: Stops "nixing" (see "setnixing
  doc" and "setnixing all" just above).</p>

</UL>

<h2>Counter manipulation commands</h2>

<UL>

  <LI><p><strong>{OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} inccounter <em>string</em>
  {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}</strong>: Increments the "counter" within
  the template execution environment which is named by the given
  string, adding 1. If the counter does not exist when this template
  is called, it will be created, and will start at 0. It will then be
  incremented to 1.</p>

  <LI><p><strong>{OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} inccounter <em>string</em>
  <em>integer</em> {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}</strong>: Increments the
  "counter" within the template execution environment which is named
  by the given string, adding the integer given. If the counter does
  not exist when this template is called, it will be created, and will
  start at 0. It will then be incremented to the integer given.</p>

  <LI><p><strong>{OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} inccounter <em>string</em> var
  <em>string</em> {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}</strong>: Increments the
  "counter" within the template execution environment which is named
  by the given string, adding the integer value contained in the
  variable named by the string after "var". If the counter does not
  exist when this template is called, it will be created, and will
  start at 0. It will then be incremented to the integer given in the
  variable.</p>

  <LI><p><strong>{OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} deccounter <em>string</em>
  {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}</strong>: Decrements the "counter" within
  the template execution environment which is named by the given
  string, subtracting 1. If the counter does not exist when this template
  is called, it will be created, and will start at 0. It will then be
  decremented to -1.</p>

  <LI><p><strong>{OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} deccounter <em>string</em>
  <em>integer</em> {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}</strong>: Decrements the
  "counter" within the template execution environment which is named
  by the given string, subtracting the integer given. If the counter does
  not exist when this template is called, it will be created, and will
  start at 0. It will then be decremented to the integer given.</p>

  <LI><p><strong>{OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} deccounter <em>string</em> var
  <em>string</em> {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}</strong>: Decrements the
  "counter" within the template execution environment which is named
  by the given string, subtracting the integer value contained in the
  variable named by the string after "var". If the counter does not
  exist when this template is called, it will be created, and will
  start at 0. It will then be decremented to the integer given in the
  variable.</p>



  <LI><p><strong>{OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} setcounter <em>string</em>
  <em>integer</em> {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}</strong>: Sets the
  "counter" within the template execution environment which is named
  by the given string, setting it to the integer given. If the counter
  does not exist when this template is called, it will be created, and
  will be set to the integer given.</p>


  <LI><p><strong>{OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} setcounter <em>string</em> var
  <em>string</em> {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}</strong>: Sets the
  "counter" within the template execution environment which is named
  by the first string, setting it to the integer value obtained from
  base-10 decoding the variable named in the second string. If the
  counter does not exist when this template is called, it will be
  created, and will be set to the integer given.</p>

</UL>

<h2>Variable manipulation commands</h2>

<UL>

  <LI><p><strong>{OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} setvar
  <em>variable-name-as-string</em> <em>new-value-as-string</em>
  {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}</strong>: Sets the string contents of a
  variable with the name given to the value given. If the variable
  does not exist, it is created.</p>

  <LI><p><strong>{OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} setvar
  <em>variable-name-as-string</em> {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}
  <em>variable contents...</em> {OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} setvarend
  {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}</strong>: Sets the string contents of a
  variable with the name given. If the variable does not exist, it is
  created. The contents of the variable are set to whatever appears
  until <strong>setvarend</strong> is met. This may include other
  templates, but may not include listappendbegin ... listappendend,
  nor may it include setvar. The setvarend template need not be in the
  same template string as the setvar template, i.e., the first
  setvarend met during execution will end the current (and only)
  setvar.</p>

  <LI><p><strong>{OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} emitvar
  <em>variable-name-as-string</em> {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}</strong>:
  Emits the contents of the variable with the name given. If the
  variable does not exist, it is initialized to be the empty
  string. </p>

</UL>


<h2>List manipulation commands</h2>

<UL>

  <LI><p><strong>{OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} listappendbegin
  <em>string</em> {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE} <em>list contents...</em>
  {OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} listappendend {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}
  </strong>: Appends the contents up to the <em>listappendend</em>
  template tag to the list named by <em>string</em>.  The contents may
  contain other templates, including listappendbegin
  ... listappendend.  If the list does not exist, it is created.  The
  contents will not be emitted until a <em>listemit</em> template tag
  which uses the name of the list is met in the processing. The
  listappendend need not appear in the same string as the
  corresponding listappendbegin. The listappendend ends the most
  recently begun list, i.e., a stack of list names is at work.

  <LI><p><strong>{OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} listemit <em>string</em>
  <em>string</em> {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}</strong>: Emits the
  elements of the list named by the first <em>string</em>. The second
  <em>string</em> is placed in between each list item.

  <LI><p><strong>{OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} listclear <em>string</em>
  {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}</strong>: Clears the list named by
  <em>string</em> (i.e., makes it empty).

</UL>

<h2>Dictionary manipulation commands</h2>

<UL>

  <LI><p><strong>{OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} dictlookup
  <em>dictname-as-string</em> feature
  <em>feature-index-as-integer</em> <em>default-as-string</em>
  {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}</strong>: Can only be used with fetchinfo,
  not renderinfo, since the features are only available in the
  fetchinfo stage. Looks up the dictionary with the given name under
  the "dictionaries" key of the fetchinfo stylesheet at hand, and then
  looks up the key given by the feature of the current object with
  feature index as given, and the emits the value, if found, or the
  default given, if not found.</p>

  <p>The feature value is mangled according to XML rules. See the
  <strong>feature</strong> template tag on this page for an
  explanation.</p>

  <p>Example: {OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} dictlookup 'booknames' feature 0
  'Unknown book ID' {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}</p>

  <LI><p><strong>{OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} dictlookup
  <em>dictname-as-string</em> featurenomangle
  <em>feature-index-as-integer</em> <em>default-as-string</em>
  {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}</strong>: This behaves just like the
  dictlookup ... feature ... counterpart, but does not XML-mangle the
  feature value before looking the feature value up. This can also
  only be used with fetchinfo, not renderinfo.</p>

  <p>Example: {OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} dictlookup 'booknames'
  featurenomangle 0 'Unknown book ID' {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}</p>

  <LI><p><strong>{OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} dictlookup
  <em>dictname-as-string</em> var <em>variable-name-as-string</em>
  <em>default-as-string</em> {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}</strong>: This
  behaves just like the dictlookup ... feature ... counterpart, but
  uses the contents of the given variable as the key into the
  dictionary. Additionally, it can be used both in fetchinfo and in
  renderinfo.</p>

  <p>The contens of the variable are XML-mangled before the
  lookup.  See the <strong>feature</strong> template tag for an
  explanation of XML-mangling.</p>

  <p>Example: {OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} dictlookup 'booknames'
  var 'bookID' 'Unknown book id' {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}</p>

  <LI><p><strong>{OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} dictlookup
  <em>dictname-as-string</em> varnomangle
  <em>variable-name-as-string</em> <em>default-as-string</em>
  {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}</strong>: This behaves just like the
  dictlookup ... var ... counterpart, but does not mangle the variable
  contents before looking up in the dictionary.

  <p>Example: {OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} dictlookup 'booknames'
  var 'bookID' 'Unknown book id' {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}</p>


  <LI><p><strong>{OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} dictlookup
  <em>dictname-as-string</em> counter <em>counter-name-as-string</em>
  <em>default-as-string</em> {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}</strong>: This
  first sees if the given counter exists. If it does not, it is
  initialized to 0. Then, its value is converted to string in
  base-10. Then, the dictionary lookup is performed as for var and
  feature, but with the counter-value as the lookup key.</p>

  <p>Example: {OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} dictlookup 'number2letter_dict'
  counter 'footnotenumber' 'Unknown number' {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}</p>

<h2>Named set manipulation commands</h2>

<p>The template language supports "named sets" of strings.  The
following template actions manipulate these.</p>

<UL>

  <em>string</em> <em>string</em> {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE} <em>named
  set contents...</em> {OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} namedsetaddend
  {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE} </strong>: Adds the string(s) up to the
  <em>namedsetaddend</em> template tag to the set named by first
  <em>string</em>.  If the named set does not exist, it is created
  before any string is added.  The contents will not be emitted until
  a <em>namedsetemit</em> template tag which uses the name of the set
  is met in the processing.</p>

  <p>The second string is a delimiter string
  which, if non-empty, is used to cut up the content string into
  substrings, which are then added one by one.</p>

  <LI><p><strong>{OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} namedsetremovebegin
  <em>string</em> <em>string</em> {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE} <em>named
  set contents to remove...</em> {OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE}
  namedsetremoveend {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE} </strong>: Removes the
  string(s) up to the <em>namedsetremoveend</em> template tag from the
  set named by first <em>string</em>.  If the named set does not exist,
  nothing happends.</p>

  <p>The second string is a delimiter string
  which, if non-empty, is used to cut up the content string into
  substrings, which are then removed one by one.</p>

  <LI><p><strong>{OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} namedsetemit <em>string</em>
  <em>string</em> {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}</strong>: Emits the
  elements of the set named by the first <em>string</em>, in memcmp
  lexicographic order. The second <em>string</em> is placed in between
  each set item, and may be empty.

  <LI><p><strong>{OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} namedsetclear <em>string</em>
  {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}</strong>: Clears the set named by
  <em>string</em> (i.e., makes it empty).

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In this section, we describe some commands that are available only
in RenderXML mode.</p>

<h2>Basic emitting commands</h2>

<UL>
  <LI><p><strong>{OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} attrib <em>identifier</em>
  {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}</strong>: Emits the contents of the
  attribute named by the "identifier", within a "renderinfo"
  stylesheet, mangling any characters that need XML mangling.</p>

  <LI><p><strong>{OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} attribnomangle <em>identifier</em>
  {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}</strong>: Emits the contents of the
  attribute named by the "identifier", within a "renderinfo"
  stylesheet, without XML mangling.</p>

  <LI><p><strong>{OPENBRACE}{OPENBRACE} copyattribs
  {CLOSEBRACE}{CLOSEBRACE}</strong>: Copy all attribute names and
  their values into the output, as though copying the element's
  attributes into a new XML document.  That is, each copied attribute
  follows the pattern ' <em>attribname</em>="<em>attribvalue</em>"',
  mangling any characters in the attribvalue that need XML
  mangling. This can only be used in a renderinfo stylesheet, not a
  fetchinfo stylesheet.</p>
