<h2>SQLite Is Public Domain</h2>

<div class="rightsidebar desktoponly">
<center>
<img src="images/nocopy.gif"><br>
SQLite is in the<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Domain">Public Domain</a>
</center>
</div>

<p>
All of the code and documentation in SQLite has been dedicated to the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Domain">public domain</a>
by the authors.
All code authors, and representatives of the companies they work for,
have signed affidavits dedicating their contributions to
the public domain and originals of
those signed affidavits are stored in a firesafe at the main offices
of <a href="https://www.hwaci.com">Hwaci</a>.  All contributors are citizens
of countries that allow creative works to be dedicated into the public
domain.
Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute
the original SQLite code, either in source code form or as a compiled binary,
for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any means.
</p>

<p>
The previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code and documentation
in SQLite - those parts of the SQLite library that you actually bundle and
ship with a larger application.  Some scripts used as part of the
build process (for example the "configure" scripts generated by autoconf)
might fall under other open-source licenses.  Nothing from these build 
scripts ever reaches the final deliverable SQLite library, however, and 
so the licenses associated with those scripts should not be 
a factor in assessing your rights to copy and use the SQLite library.
</p>

<p>
All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch.
No code has been taken from other projects or from the open
internet.  Every line of code can be traced back to its original
author, and all of those authors have public domain dedications
on file.  So the SQLite code base is clean and is
uncontaminated with licensed code from other projects.
</p>

<a name="notopencontrib"></a>

<h2>Open-Source, not Open-Contribution</h2>

<p>
SQLite is open-source, meaning that you can make as many copies of it as
you want and do whatever you want with those copies, without limitation.
But SQLite is not open-contribution.  In order to keep SQLite in the public
domain and ensure that the code does not become contaminated with proprietary
or licensed content, the project does not accept patches from people who
have not submitted an affidavit dedicating their contribution into the
public domain.

<p>
All of the code in SQLite is original, having been written
specifically for use by SQLite.  No code has been copied from unknown
sources on the internet.

<a name="warrantyoftitle"></a>


<div class="rightsidebar">
<form method="GET" action="https://www.sqlite.org/purchase/license">
<input type="submit" value="Buy An SQLite License">
</form>
</div>

<h2>Warranty of Title</h2>

<p>
SQLite is in the public domain and does not require a license.
Even so, some organizations want legal proof of their right to use
SQLite.  Circumstances where this might occurs include the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Your company desires indemnity against claims of copyright infringement.
<li> You are using SQLite in a jurisdiction that does not recognize
     the public domain.  </li>
<li> You are using SQLite in a jurisdiction that does not recognize
     the right of an author to dedicate their work to the public
     domain. </li>
<li> You want to hold a tangible legal document
     as evidence that you have the legal right to use and distribute
     SQLite. </li>
<li> Your legal department tells you that you must purchase a license.
     </li>
</ul>

<p>
If any of the above circumstances apply to you,
<a href="https://www.hwaci.com/">Hwaci</a>, the company that employs 
all the developers of SQLite, will 
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/purchase/license">sell you
a Warranty of Title for SQLite</a>.
A Warranty of Title is a legal document that asserts that the claimed
authors of SQLite are the true authors, and that the authors 
have the legal right to dedicate the SQLite to the public domain, and 
that Hwaci will vigorously defend against challenges to those claims.
All proceeds from the sale of SQLite Warranties of Title are used to fund
continuing improvement and support of SQLite.
</p>

<h2>Contributed Code</h2>

<p>
In order to keep SQLite completely free and unencumbered by copyright,
the project does not accept patches.  If you would like to suggest a
change and you include a patch as a proof-of-concept, that would
be great.  However, please do not be offended if we rewrite your patch
from scratch.
