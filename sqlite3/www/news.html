<h2>Recent News</h2>

<a name="2013_jan_09"></a><h3>2013-Jan-09 - Release 3.7.15.2</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_15_2.html">version 3.7.15.2</a> is a patch release that fixes a single bug
  that was introduced in version <a href="releaselog/3_7_15.html">version 3.7.15</a>.  The fix is a 4-character
  edit to a single line of code.  Other than this 4-character change and
  the update of the version number, nothing has changed from
  <a href="releaselog/3_7_15_1.html">version 3.7.15.1</a>.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2012_dec_19"></a><h3>2012-Dec-19 - Release 3.7.15.1</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_15_1.html">version 3.7.15.1</a> is a patch release that fixes a single bug
  that was introduced in version <a href="releaselog/3_7_15.html">version 3.7.15</a>.  The fix involved changing
  two lines of code and adding a single assert().  This release also includes
  some new test cases to prevent a regression of the bug, and the version
  number is increased, of course.  But otherwise, nothing has changed from
  <a href="releaselog/3_7_15.html">version 3.7.15</a>.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2012_dec_12"></a><h3>2012-Dec-12 - Release 3.7.15</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_15.html">version 3.7.15</a> is a regularly schedule release of SQLite.  This
  release contains several improvements to the query planner and optimizer
  and one important bug fix.  This is the first release to officially
  support Windows 8 Phone.</p>

<p>  The important bug fix is a problem that can lead to segfaults when using
  <a href="sharedcache.html">shared cache mode</a> on a schema that contains a <a href="lang_expr.html#collateop">COLLATE operator</a> within
  a <a href="lang_createtable.html#ckconst">CHECK constraint</a> or within a <a href="lang_createview.html">view</a>.  Collating functions are associated
  with individual database connections.  But a pointer to the collating function
  was also being cached within expressions.  If an expression was part of the
  schema and contained a cached collating function, it would point to the
  collating function in the database connection that originally parsed the
  schema.  If that database connection closed while other database 
  connections using the same shared cache continued to operate, they other
  database connections would try to use the deallocated collating function
  in the database connection that closed.  The fix in version 3.7.15 was to
  not cache collating function pointers in the expression structure but 
  instead look them up each time a new statement is prepared.</p>

<p>  This release also contains some important enhancements to the query planner
  which should (we hope) make some queries run faster.  The enhancements
  include:</p>

<p>  <ol><li><p>When doing a full-table scan, try to use an index instead of
  the original table, under the theory that indices contain less information
  and are thus smaller and hence require less disk I/O to scan.</p></p>

<p>  <li><p>Enhance the <a href="lang_expr.html#in_op">IN operator</a> to allow it to make use of 
  indices that have <a href="datatype3.html#affinity">numeric affinity</a>.</p></p>

<p>  <li><p>Do a better job of recognizing when an ORDER BY clause can be 
  implemented using indices - especially in cases where the ORDER BY clause
  contains terms from two or more tables in a join.</p>
  </ol>
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2012_oct_04"></a><h3>2012-Oct-04 - Release 3.7.14.1</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_14_1.html">version 3.7.14.1</a> is a patch release.  Changes from the baseline
  version 3.7.14 are minimal and are restricted to fixing three bugs.</p>

<p>  One of the fixed bugs is a long-standing issue with the TCL interface.
  Another is an external compiler bug that SQLite merely works around and
  that only comes up if you are using the VisualStudio-2012 compiler to
  generate WinRT applications on ARM with optimizations enabled.  The
  third problem is an SQLite core bug, introduced in version 3.7.14, that
  can cause a segfault if a query contains a LEFT JOIN that contains an OR
  in the ON clause.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2012_sep_03"></a><h3>2012-Sep-03 - Release 3.7.14</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_14.html">version 3.7.14</a> is a regularly scheduled maintenance release
  of SQLite.  The previous release continues to work well.  Upgrading
  is optional.</p>

<p>  Version 3.7.14 drops native support for OS/2.  We are not aware of any
  active projects that were using SQLite on OS/2 and since the SQLite
  developers had no way of testing on OS/2 it seemed like it was time
  to simply remove the OS/2 code from the SQLite tree.  If there are
  OS/2 projects out there that still need SQLite support, they can
  continue to maintain their own private <a href="vfs.html">VFS</a> which can be linked to
  SQLite at start-time using the <a href="c3ref/vfs_find.html">sqlite3_vfs_register()</a> interface.</p>

<p>  The <a href="c3ref/close.html">sqlite3_close_v2()</a> interface has been added.  The sqlite3_close_v2()
  interface differs from sqlite3_close() in that it is designed to work
  better for host language that use a garbage collector.  With the older
  sqlite3_close() interface, the associated <a href="c3ref/stmt.html">prepared statements</a> and
  <a href="c3ref/backup.html">sqlite3_backup</a> objects must be destroyed before the database connection.
  With the newer sqlite3_close_v2() interface, the objects can be destroyed
  in any order.</p>

<p>  This release also includes performance improvements to the sort algorithm
  that is used to implement ORDER BY and CREATE INDEX.  And the query planner
  has been enhanced to better use covering indices on queries that use OR
  terms in the WHERE clause.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2012_june_11"></a><h3>2012-June-11 - Release 3.7.13</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_13.html">version 3.7.13</a> adds support for WinRT and metro style
  applications for Microsoft Windows 8.  The 3.7.13 release is
  coming sooner than is usual after the previous release in order to get
  this new capability into the hands of developers.  To use SQLite in 
  a metro style application, compile with the -DSQLITE_OS_WINRT flag.
  Because of the increased application security and safety requirements
  of WinRT, all database
  filenames should be full pathnames.  Note that SQLite is not capable
  of accessing databases outside the installation directory and application
  data directory.  This restriction is another security and safety feature
  of WinRT. Apart from these restrictions, SQLite should work exactly
  the same on WinRT as it does on every other system.</p>

<p>  Also in this release: when a database is opened using <a href="uri.html">URI filenames</a>
  and the <a href="uri.html#coreqp">mode=memory</a> query parameter 
  then the database is an in-memory database, just as if it had
  been named ":memory:".  But, if shared cache mode is enabled, then
  all other database connections that specify the same URI filename
  will connect to the same in-memory database.  This allows two or more
  database connections (in the same process) to share the same in-memory
  database.</p>

<p>  This release also includes some corner-case performance optimizations
  that are obscure yet significant to an important subset of SQLite users.
  Getting these performance optimizations into circulation quickly is
  yet another reason for making this release so soon following the previous.</p>

<p>  The next release of SQLite is scheduled to occur after the usual
  2 or 3 month interval.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2012_may_22"></a><h3>2012-May-22 - Patch Release 3.7.12.1</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_12_1.html">version 3.7.12.1</a> is a patch release for <a href="releaselog/3_7_12.html">version 3.7.12</a> that
  fixes a <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/src/info/c2ad16f997ee9c">bug</a> that was
  introduced in version 3.7.12 and that can
  cause a segfault for certain obscure nested aggregate queries.
  There are very few changes in 3.7.12.1, and upgrading is only needed for
  applications that do nested aggregate queries.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2012_may_14"></a><h3>2012-May-14 - <a href="releaselog/3_7_12.html">Version 3.7.12</a></h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_12.html">version 3.7.12</a> is a regularly scheduled maintenance release.
  This release contains several new optimizations and bug fixes and upgrading
  is recommended.  See the <a href="releaselog/3_7_12.html">change summary</a> for details.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2012_march_20"></a><h3>2012-March-20 - <a href="releaselog/3_7_11.html">Version 3.7.11</a></h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_11.html">version 3.7.11</a> is a regularly scheduled maintenance release
  which was rushed out early due to a 
  <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/src/info/b7c8682cc1">bug in the query optimizer</a>
  introduced in the previous release.  The bug is obscure - it changes
  a LEFT JOIN into an INNER JOIN in some cases when there is a 3-way join
  and OR terms in the WHERE clause.  But it was considered serious enough to
  rush out a fix.  Apart from this one problem, SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_10.html">version 3.7.10</a> has
  not given any trouble.  Upgrading to <a href="releaselog/3_7_11.html">version 3.7.11</a> from versions
  3.7.6.3, 3.7.7, 3.7.7.1, 3.7.8, or 3.7.9 is
  optional.  Upgrading from other releases, including the previous release
  3.7.10, is recommended.</p>

<p>  Other enhancements found in this release are enumerated in the
  <a href="releaselog/3_7_11.html">change log</a>.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2012_january_16"></a><h3>2012-January-16 - <a href="releaselog/3_7_10.html">Version 3.7.10</a></h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_10.html">version 3.7.10</a> is a regularly scheduled maintenance release.
  Upgrading from version 3.7.6.3, 3.7.7, 3.7.7.1, 3.7.8, or 3.7.9 is
  optional.  Upgrading from other releases is recommended.</p>

<p>  The <a href="c3ref/c_config_covering_index_scan.html#sqliteconfigpcache">SQLITE_CONFIG_PCACHE</a> mechanism has been replaced with
  <a href="c3ref/c_config_covering_index_scan.html#sqliteconfigpcache2">SQLITE_CONFIG_PCACHE2</a>.  If you do not know what this mechanism
  is (it is an extreme corner-case and is seldom used) then this 
  change will not effect you in the least.</p>

<p>  The default <a href="fileformat2.html#schemaformat">schema format number</a> for new database files has changed
  from 1 to 4.  SQLite has been able to generate and read database files
  using schema format 4 for six years.  But up unto now, the default
  schema format has been 1 so that older versions of SQLite could read
  and write databases generated by newer versions of SQLite.  But those
  older versions of SQLite have become so scarce now that it seems 
  reasonable to make the new format the default.</p>

<p>  SQLite is changing some of the assumptions it makes above the behavior
  of disk drives and flash memory devices during a sudden power loss.
  This change is completely transparent to applications.
  Read about the <a href="psow.html">powersafe overwrite</a> property for additional information.</p>

<p>  Lots of new interfaces have been added in this release:
  <ul>
  <li> <a href="c3ref/db_release_memory.html">sqlite3_db_release_memory()</a>
  <li> <a href="pragma.html#pragma_shrink_memory">PRAGMA shrink_memory</a>
  <li> <a href="c3ref/db_filename.html">sqlite3_db_filename()</a>
  <li> <a href="c3ref/stmt_busy.html">sqlite3_stmt_busy()</a>
  <li> <a href="c3ref/uri_boolean.html">sqlite3_uri_boolean()</a>
  <li> <a href="c3ref/uri_boolean.html">sqlite3_uri_int64()</a>
  </ul></p>

<p>  The <a href="pragma.html#pragma_cache_size">PRAGMA cache_size</a> statement has been enhanced.  Formerly, you would
  use this statement to tell SQLite how many pages of the database files it
  should hold in its cache at once.  The total memory requirement would
  depend on the database page size. Now, if you give <a href="pragma.html#pragma_cache_size">PRAGMA cache_size</a>
  a negative value -N, it will allocate roughly N 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibibyte">kibibytes</a> of memory to cache,
  divided up according to page size.  This enhancement allows programs to
  more easily control their memory usage.</p>

<p>  There have been several obscure bug fixes.  One noteworthy bug,
  ticket <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/src/info/ff5be73dee">ff5be73dee</a>,
  could in theory result in a corrupt database file if a power loss
  occurred at just the wrong moment on an unusually cantankerous disk
  drive.  But that is mostly a theoretical concern and is very unlikely
  to happen in practice.  The bug was found during laboratory testing
  and has never been observed to occur in the wild.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2011_november_01"></a><h3>2011-November-01 - <a href="releaselog/3_7_9.html">Version 3.7.9</a></h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_9.html">version 3.7.9</a> is a regularly scheduled maintenance release.
  Upgrading from version 3.7.6.3, 3.7.7, 3.7.7.1, and 3.7.8 is optional.
  Upgrading from other versions is recommended.</p>

<p>  The <a href="compile.html#enable_stat2">SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT2</a> compile-time option is now a no-op.  The enhanced
  query-planner functionality formerly available using SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT2
  is now available through <a href="compile.html#enable_stat3">SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT3</a>.  The enhanced query planning
  is still disabled by default.  However, future releases of SQLite might
  convert STAT3 from an enable-option to a disable-option so that it is 
  available by default and is only omitted upon request.</p>

<p>  The <a href="fts3.html#fts4">FTS4</a> full-text search engine has been enhanced such that tokens in
  the search string that begin with "&#94" must be the first token in their
  respective columns in order to match.   Formerly, "&#94;" characters in the
  search string were simply ignored.  Hence, if a legacy application was
  including "&#94;" characters in FTS4 search strings, thinking that they would
  always be ignored, then those legacy applications might break with this
  update.  The fix is simply remove the "&#94;" characters from the search 
  string.</p>

<p>  See the <a href="releaselog/3_7_9.html">change summary</a> for additional changes associated
  with this release.  
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2011_september_19"></a><h3>2011-September-19 - <a href="releaselog/3_7_8.html">Version 3.7.8</a></h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_8.html">version 3.7.8</a> is a quarterly maintenance release.  Upgrading from
  versions 3.7.6.3, 3.7.7, or 3.7.7.1 is optional.  Upgrading from other
  versions is recommended.</p>

<p>  This release features a new "external merge sort" algorithm used to
  implement ORDER BY and GROUP BY and also to presort the content of an
  index for CREATE INDEX.  The new algorithm does approximately the same
  number of comparisons and I/Os as before, but the I/Os are much more
  sequential and so runtimes are greatly reduced when the size of the
  set being sorted is larger than the filesystem cache.  The performance 
  improvement can be dramatic - orders of magnitude faster 
  for large CREATE INDEX commands.  On the other hand, 
  the code is slightly slower (1% or 2%)
  for a small CREATE INDEX.  Since CREATE INDEX is not an
  operation that commonly occurs on a speed-critical path, we feel that 
  this tradeoff is a good one.  The slight slowdown for small CREATE INDEX
  statements might be recovered in a future release.  ORDER BY and GROUP BY
  operations should now be faster for all cases, large and small.</p>

<p>  The query planner has been enhanced to do a better job of handling
  the DISTINCT keyword on SELECT statements.</p>

<p>  There has been a lot of work on the default <a href="vfs.html">VFSes</a>.  The unix VFS has
  been enhanced to include more overrideable system calls - a feature requested
  by Chromium to make it easier to build SQLite into a sandbox.  The
  windows VFS has been enhanced to be more resistant to interference from
  anti-virus software.</p>

<p>  Every version of SQLite is better tested than the previous, and 3.7.8
  is no exception to this rule.  Version 3.7.8 has been used internally by
  the SQLite team for mission critical functions and has performed flawlessly.
  And, of course, it passes our rigorous <a href="testing.html">testing</a> procedures with no
  problems detected.  Version 3.7.8 is recommended for all new development.
